Any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully like to know in what way your and Twitter pages have been unsuccessful nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure. But you have more than failure to guide you. You say that all your life you have helped others with their so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful. Adapting this experience to your presence makes obvious but I imagine done this for the advice a surprising number of problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others. They are genuinely and often because a boss or colleague see things in the same way. Empathy comes naturally to but others have to work at it. it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion. As a solver of other problems some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable As someone who has worked in a role my whole I would In my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing do for a host of rational or do because not journalists or famous. Journalism is probably the more reliable because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design. Being a professional or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues but you simply have enough information to provide anything truly helpful. Consider volunteering with an such as the which provides training and support. It responds to people who are in jail or at school anyone who wants to talk. Being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much not about the adviser than the person asking for help. ask why that route in particular that appeals. It is about having an appropriate background in a reputation for having a balanced approach to and a substantial amount of luck. Train to be a a psychotherapist. take years and money most of you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help. Write to yourself for advice. If good advice you will reach your goal.

Trump lies like he at all sometimes in malice and sometimes in and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all. The Guardian has more than 100 falsehoods made by the Republican nominee over the last 150 and sorted them according to has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her for instance about her email practices and her past support for the Partnership. But often makes her falsehoods in dense making them hard to pin a motive many could as easily be errors as careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading on the other will say when he hears his own quotes. His own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his court documents show. He has invented false fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named to talk about his sex life. Months of reveal methods whether he means to or guide to success through new emails show no criminal wrongdoing Read and Trump has described and its leaders in apocalyptic terms. He thought weak and he lambasted Bush and Bill and after supporting W quickly dismissed that war as crime is always rising national rate fell for and are in are Migrants are flooding in are leaving than and they bring violence is no evidence that they Civilian and military leaders are always clueless received five deferments from except when they love him. We have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants and they take our jobs know very well who they they include his vision of the US has for one of dystopia he even described the as a crisis worse than the Great Depression. But amid all this desolation Trump gains three things. He fuels doubt and leaving people he denigrates his opposition en blaming the world on and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage. big a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too Trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as from his worth estimates to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless is pierced throughout by paperwork. In the Guardian found that Trump valued a New golf course at in one document and at in a court filing sued to pay lower On the New Times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income. The Post has shown repeatedly that boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed environmental and tried the ploy in he has called the millions his father gave him as small and portrayed his loss in 1995 as an example of tax sort of exaggeration is a common sales overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained downward. In Trump confessed about his then quickly said building a wall on the southern border was the equivalent of a liar I say is but not at the messenger Twitter Trump on and the in Trump attacks what he calls dishonest accusing reporters of inaccuracy and a failure to show the size of his rallies. He ignores that reporters quote him call his campaign for interview his his campaign and independent voters and experts. He often cites news stories about and even praised in a presidential debate for catching her in a every Trump says the cameras refuse to show his even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching can see. Only one camera at each event stays fixed on the shared whose footage networks share and which stays on Trump so as not to miss his a target for criticism from the noted that Trump joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera is a shtick that he does to rile up his she give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his to give them an excuse to berate someone not scorched earth like his attacks on other try to authority and leave only himself in its place. But while most still respect other institutions that Trump has the press was vulnerable. Decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the and the has sapped major newspapers of their powers to compete with openly partisan fake news and social media networks. Trump tried to fill the fire not most famous false about birthplace and who started is only one of was father and drawn from a tabloid with ties to the climate change that was by the the who cheered the vaccines that cause the Miss Universe the political correctness of the secret president and his secret terror and the plot of bankers and the category includes what the Dale calls the oddest of falsehoods. These claims include an invented letter from the about the authorship of the poem The and that Frank hate My Way his entire life. Trump himself seems to get lost in the and sometimes slips into a Dadaist jumble of allusions cattle 33,000 emails that sound sinister when put together. This is apparently the desired a haze of noxious even if no one has found fire for all that smoke. For more than 20 journalists and congressional Republicans have tried. The latter have spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating the associations and careless email practices but have yet to find criminal conduct. Arguably worst conspiracy is his insistence that voter fraud has the which merges his fringe claims with his attack on institutions. No evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible but the claim gives Trump something to blame failure on besides himself. Like his other it sows doubt and diminishing the nation so that Trump can portray himself as an favorite escape from this maze is the phrase something going which lets Trump suggest claim ignorance and say nothing of substance at everything Twitter never used language as bad as Jay in my cornered by his own quotes or something he Trump often lies with blunt denials or variations of the phrases very or look into Inside a Trump good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate Read also tries to wriggle out of uncomfortable situations with this most notably when he claimed ignorance of the former leader who has professed approval for his and white supremacists.

But really impressed by the sorts of things they share about politics very funny and have definitely made mistakes gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things I have. There have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in. And they have all asked me to take down various photos.

The kids have occasionally living your life on but an open all fairly streetwise. We have a very open in our house.

It took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more children were very little when I first signed up. I remember thinking much about privacy then.

was something endearingly old school about the jailbreak that brought to mind the robber who achieved notoriety in the by escaping from three high security prisons. Those of us who have watched too many episodes of Toughest Jails have grown used to the idea of the modern prison as a fortress where inmates go to rot until they die. Not so where two prisoners managed to recreate their own version of the Redemption by sawing through their bars and escaping to the street via a series of sheets that had been knotted together. The absence went unnoticed for many hours because they had placed mannequins in their beds to make it look as if they were still asleep. Quite where the prisoners got their files and mannequins from has not yet been made public. The most likely guess is that the files were hidden inside a cake brought in by a visitor and that the mannequins were borrowed from the fashion design rehabilitation a thought for who has been under the impression that the reason he was made a peer in 1996 was because John Major really enjoyed his musicals. has now declared his outrage at being expected to turn up in person from time to time to cast a vote in of the Conservatives and has said he is minded to become a so that he can hang on to his peerage and do nothing in return.

So just four of the stories that get the attention they would otherwise have had the media not had their eyes on the US presidential election. the publication of the report into significant failings by the Metropolitan police into the child sex abuse scandal got considerably less attention than it otherwise would.

It was a warm morning in and on a farm just north of Bell 46 runners gathered at the starting preparing to run one of the yet most of races. Called the Big Backyard the race required contestants to run a course that spanned 4.167 over trails etched out of the every hour. If you finished faster than an you got five or 10 minutes to rest or eat or go to the bathroom before the next round. If it took you longer than an you were out. The race would keep hour after blessed until there was only one runner left. The reason the Big Backyard had chosen 4.167 miles for his course is that if you ran 24 loops in 24 have gone exactly 100 miles. the reason named it Big Backyard Ultra was Big was the name of his and the farm on which the race was run in his Virtually all the runners had experience. had won a in just the month with a time of 23 hours 16 minutes 31 seconds. had placed third in a race in last One man told me he would soon be running from to Another said he was using this race as preparation for a coming race.

He told me recently that the moment he craves is the moment when every fiber of his being screams need that moment when I is how he put it. When he first started did it as a form of penance was feeling badly about myself and wanted to punish he said. as he realized he was good at running long and even more extreme events became a way to test his limits to some build his celebrity. Five years running took on another role in his It helped keep him sane. runs long distances not only because he loves it but because it is one thing he can do that nobody can take away from him. To put it another running has saved his life. The first time I ever spoke to he was calling me from a telephone in a prison in This was in the spring of three years after the financial crisis. In the wake of that millions of people lost their homes during the they had taken on mortgages they ultimately afford. who had gotten caught up in the housing was in prison for mortgage fraud. At the I was writing columns in the business section of The New a number of which focused on the unwillingness of the Justice Department to hold accountable the top executives of the companies that had led the country over the like of Countrywide. And yet here was this smallest of small who had lost two houses during the sentenced to 21 months in jail for supposedly committing bank fraud. The more I looked into the sketchier the whole situation seemed. It had begun after an Internal Revenue Service agent watched a produced by about an expedition had a grueling run across the The agent started wondering how had time to earn a living with all the time he spent running. He opened an investigation it included Dumpster dives outside apartment that found nothing wrong with his taxes. But an undercover female assigned to befriend got him to brag about taking a couple of while she secretly had a tape recorder rolling. Liar loan is the term for loans in which people overstate their incomes to qualify for mortgages they probably have. Millions of people took out liar loans during the housing just as did. Thousands of brokers encouraged them to do just as broker did. And as it turns the evidence against was so thin that the jury found him innocent of providing false information to the bank even as it was convicting him of bank fraud. Go figure. The point I made in the column is that something wrong with a system that sends to prison and lets go free. It often happen this but something good came out of my It helped get a book contract.

So he decided to run 135 the same length as and to do it on the same day in that was being held on the West Coast. Of course he had to prepare at one point the prison was in and he get outdoors to do the he had planned that day. So he ran the equivalent of 15 miles in place in his cell.

The the the press. The the the business leaders. victory makes the upset of look like a quaint tiff over a round of Trump wins presidential plunging US into uncertain future Read and its relationship to the world has fundamentally changed overnight. An era that stretches back to Franklin D just came to an abrupt and ugly end. Instead of being an globalist the United States has definitively turned shutting its borders to and any number of other perceived enemies of demagogic the same itself has been redefined. The bond between its president and its constitution will be if Trump pursues a fraction of what he so clearly promised through this extraordinary political enemies notably can expect prosecution led by an that previously found no grounds for legal action over her private email server. The Trump Department of Justice will seek prison time for and the only barrier to this punishment is the third and independent branch of the promised a deportation force to round up hundreds of if not of undocumented immigrants starting on his inauguration day in His transition to government will surely be dominated by plans to rip through the communities of largest cities.

For anyone who grew up during the cold the threat of nuclear annihilation is a distant memory of what was once an ever present nightmare. For those born as the cold war came to an the fear of global destruction will be a new and the political establishment in needs to figure out quickly how to respond to this revolution. Republican leaders who shunned Trump will now stampede to his but they are unlikely to be forgiven by a man who harbors long and deep grudges.

He said he worked with and would cut the cost of the second shipment to if I paid his company via credit card and canceled the check for to I gave him our credit card I canceled the check to and once this is over.

A maiden. 15th 81-2 continues and is looking better with every over. That wicket might have given second thoughts about trying to dismissively swat him from the attack. A lovely drifting ball turns and beats who eventually gets four with a very lovely sweep from outside off from the last ball. Good bowling and good batting in that Lisle becomes the first person ever to deliver 40,000 words on civil rights and take a Test wicket in the same 2016 14th 75-2 The new new man a is off the mark in style after Stokes takes a wicket with the first ball.

His third ball is wide rubbish angled across but not tempted. He does pull hard at a straighter bouncer but get hold of the ball tumbling to midwicket for just a single.

This could be fun. 11th 61-0 Another reverse another boundary to through the region formerly known as point. to his asks for a field change and gets it. about to curl up in a shivering ball thinking about what and co are going to do to this attack. Four for 10th 56-0 The boundaries are flowing and are scoring at an rate. drops his hands and edges wide of the slips and down to the rope at third man to bring up the 50 for A then plays an absolutely brilliant lofted cover hard and over the close field for four more. This is cracking would have had Stokes open the bowling with his figures in the first innings to keep it tight and to keep the pressure then at the other end to make things Mo but I think wise to keep Stokes back and let the spinners rough up the ball so he can get it reversing. I see Stokes as a kind of bowler. 9th 46-0 Down the leg side from and sweeps but he can only get one as a sweeper coming round. likes the sweep too when tosses one on he reverses it beautifully to pick up four more. 28 from 28 balls now. 8th 41-0 is the cry as sweeps hard and in the air out towards It goes too fast for Stokes out in the deep to pick it up and away the ball goes for four.

After a plays a nice cut off a wide ball but can only get a single to point. When in this kind of is a lovely player to just the third bowler to take a haul in each of his first two Tests after and 2016 3rd 16-0 gives round the wicket a brief go to and to little avail. After a single he goes too full to whose first innings hundred is looking increasingly outstanding. He looks good leaning into that ball and clipping it off his ankles with gorgeous timing and through to the midwicket boundary. Another ball is knocked in front of square leg for two more. The lead is down to eight. 2nd 9-0 from the other with two slips in place for the use his spinners especially well as ninth wicket eroded so be interesting to see how Cook does. a big shout for when prods forward but he was hit outside the as both and point out so Cook thought point out that is not a talented musician.

So just when we thought that 2016 get any more it with a Trump victory. I told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the Cubs winning the World Series and all. I hear that New Yorkers are taking it pretty hard. Are people stocking up on canned Greetings from the Land of Duck and Not sure quite sunk in. But foods and subterranean real estate are in demand. and sounds like a hunting club. So where shall we a little weary of the conversations. get right to what do you think will happen Trump will set up an administration. The sun will rise in the east. My dog will chase squirrels. The world will go on. Glad to hear taking it well. He stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy. I think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics. So perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future. been since I came to at the collective failure to understand that point. It is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history. In Democrats were popping Champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics. Now they see most of their dreams being unraveled. And Republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable. I made a Things are looking better already. Both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors. The losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country. Reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think. We in all that much demand. And the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side. looking at a President Trump and a House and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things. Presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two. President did that with health care. His agenda was nothing compared to W. who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion. But was certainly a big lift. It was also a central campaign promise. I know you think it was a bad idea. I think that strategy is enormously shortsighted. I remember thinking when the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist Republicans into Some day the Republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in And sure here we are. My point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology. why he got elected. But I think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to Is Spinal turn it up to 11. Give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most. The Trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed. We part company here. My perception of was of a Democratic Party willing to work on compromise legislation while the Republicans just stalled. There was no unified Republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind. But the bottom line is that left behind the old Congress. now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the House gym. Secretly a lot of them are actually but I take your point. And another recommendation I would make to President Make friends everyplace. That was the magic. golf with the same people every week. Since I have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while. The Republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through Congress. Trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program. So see what he comes up with. I know a big fan. His agenda and agenda really do Congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and Trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe. plan includes a health care replacement plan for It will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered. I realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing. This is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe. I remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on Grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions. seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair. Followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt. certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime. Nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit Only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big. But move on. obviously cranky. How Any other How about the early The Republican establishment seems to have as White House chief of staff. But is going to be chief strategist. Which could mean anything. To me is the kind of guy Democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a Republican White House. But is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the Trump crowd. Who do you think will really have the It looks like both will be influential. After watching the I find pair of appointments too surprising. They signal that in as during his Trump will seek to merge traditional Republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism. And what about It seems now the wall may be a and the deportees will be only criminals. has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years. see where the big switch is. I think given what heard so far. In that Trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. Those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared. been thinking a lot about the source of strength rural areas and declining small cities. you always told me that one of our problems is that have stopped moving to where the jobs Apparently right and prefer to stay be angry and elect Trump president. one interpretation. Another is that people simply have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills. So they stay put. I find this the more compelling view. I always prefer the explanation that just boil down a move I have three so I confess to using that approach sometimes. As to how all this affected my colleague Nick published a wonderful book earlier this year called Without It shows the collapse of employment among men over the past 50 years. This got much worse in the wake of the Great Recession and the disappointing most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution. In other the economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population. Important which I plan to reiterate regularly when Trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks. The problem just material especially given the expansion of welfare benefits. the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work. For neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education. an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural I think all pretty clear today that a cry of rage from white And Trump was pretty good on the end. But beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan which was actually clearer on I heard a whole lot of solutions. When Trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals. But I talked to tons of people supporting Trump who basically know if that stuff will work. But finally a guy who at least is saying try something to bring back someone who cared about them. The bottom line was change versus no change. almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and I am sorry to say that was the candidate. All she promised was more of the administration plus that infrastructure repair. It made sense in many ways. The country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under But if not a happy going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate. I know this election is really hard for progressives to but a way to understand at least in part. A few years ago I was having lunch with who is president of the Center for Progress and liberal think tank presidents are secretly I asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved President so much. She gives them I thought that was very and I think a big part of going on today as well with Trump. I like your as far as the emotions goes. As to ability to follow through see how it works out. Especially if the new first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks. I just laughed out loud about that one. But the holidays are and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24-7 politics. why God invented football. Obviously we share the same basic theology. be taking a conversational too. But while being thankful on be counting our talks as one of my blessings. Me Happy Thanksgiving.

My family may be but I have always been a and I officially registered for the party shortly after my 18th birthday. The first Trump rally I went to was in Las last year. The crowd was joyful and people were singing and and when Trump got up on stage all eyes were on rally and ensured I did everything possible to get Trump elected. My father and his family are from and my mum is half so I joined for My whole senior year of high I volunteered countless hours for the Trump making phone speaking to knocking on doors. I researched issues faces such as our and policies I feel are failing including Trump has promised to tackle these issues head on. Trump will be great for by bringing jobs and investing in inner cities by lowering wants to repeal to achieve a cheaper service. A more free market in will increase competition for consumers among insurance and ensure that our prices will get lower. He has also said he will renegotiate the North Free Trade Agreement and make sure is not put in place. He has be talking about our terrible trade deals since the whereas has voted in of every one of these disastrous deals that have cost media has tried to suggest are all against but a chunk of us cast votes for him according to exit polls. Many of the comments Trump has made about such as calling them have been taken completely out of context. He has only said a certain portion of illegal immigrants coming across the southern border are committing which is surely true. Twitter In his book Crippled Trump talks about his certainty that many illegal immigrants in are but with the US in its current state we have to put first. There are more than 3 billion people in the world who live in poverty. The US help every single one of them. We have to focus on feeding the 13 million starving the single mothers who under have gone into and our veterans who have lost their cares about our wellbeing and our future. He wants to lower taxes to make it easier for working families to make money and start and he wants to help stimulate the economy and create more jobs which will tackle all these issues. how he won over the middle and working classes. When he first announced he was he said he would be greatest jobs president god ever I was walking in a local mall and spoke with another my age who said she necessarily against Trump but just unclear of his and trust the negativity about him in the voters in their own country split in two and at rock Read talked about his policies on trade and bringing jobs and she agreed with him that we need to get big money out of politics. She had supported but said she would look more into Trump. Those are the policies that have appealed to people like desire to deport illegal immigrants alarm me. It needs to be done. He wants to deport stop employers from hiring illegal immigrants by implementing an system system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in and only then push those left towards a path of Throughout his campaign Trump has said many times that he loves and that are a major backbone of this represents the ability to be straightforward about life and to be passionate in everything we do. He will be great for my community by bringing jobs investing over in inner cities where a lot of minorities live by lowering and through improvements to education which is a major issue in our community. He wants to end Common Core the educational standards initiative which dictates what students must be taught and give the power back to parents and teachers to decide how children are educated. Twitter In has offended many because she supported policies that have taken jobs away from the and risked national security with a vulnerable personal email server that could have been hacked. For 30 years has been part of the putting money before citizens. No wonder so many vote for an 18 year old from a living in a small town close to Las Trump gave me the chance to intern for his campaign. It has transformed me as a person. On the occasions met him he has treated me like an equal and listened to every word I have said. I want to become the first president of the United and the way Trump has stuck to his message no matter what has inspired me beyond words. All can agree we want a leader who has our best interests at heart. Trump was elected on the basis he would put first. sure that people will unite behind his presidency when they see that followed through on his elections

I want to raise the canopy of my mature holly tree to put a bench under it. How and when do I do best time to prune a holly is in late the idea being that it have time to put on any new growth before winter sets in. In you can prune as crown as this technique is is very different from pruning a hedge. In spring you may see a flush of growth from the places you have but just have to keep removing these new why my wildflowers Read lower branches back to the trunk using loppers or a pruning saw. Look for the branch collar the slight bulge where branch meets trunk and make your cut just outside this point. Go as once a branch is no going back. If you add whole holly branches to the compost heap be cursing those prickly leaves for years to so shred them first. you could be thrifty and use the branches to protect emerging broad beans from nibbling or make a dead hedge somewhere hidden as a wildlife Got a question for Email 
A month ago I tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off. There is a darkness about Trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever. In saying so I am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women. I mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party. His convention was a fiasco. He had no ground game to speak of. The list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short. He needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the Bush and among others. He even lost for now he is going to be president of the United States. The woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time. Everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference. The man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the Oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a Trump victory. After there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him. He has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task. He has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass. Maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves. We going to win anything. What happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world. As President Trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne. What we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went What species of guided our Democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top. she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail. But she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment. An insider when the country was screaming for an outsider. A technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine. Twitter victory speech in was the Democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every Democrat in up a notch. Whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted. Had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go. There was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure. Each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so Democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which Trump exploited to the fullest. They chose even though they knew about her private email server. They chose her even though some of those who studied the Foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the Republican is a monster is to court disbelief. If Trump is a as liberals often Democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn. Choosing her indicated either that Democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either. It always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her. With the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a Cold War propaganda station. what it consisted was virtually without flaws. She was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real. The economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans. Racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the Republican candidate. How did the crusade The fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus. They chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them. They transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting. What could possibly have gone wrong with such an Put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016. The class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment. And then they lost. Maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells Democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at The rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these Democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world. It is a liberalism of the it has failed the middle and now it has failed on its own terms of Enough with these comfortable Democrats and their cozy system.

you anyone said that to you after one your happened to me. In if I had a pound for every time heard that I would be well on the way to bridging the pay gap between academic and technical teaching am a technical instructor. all about pushing buttons and pulling I even pronounce let alone deliver it. Many higher education institutes running degrees employ technical instructors to teach the areas not covered by the theory in the lecture rooms. My particular group of instructors is made up of people who have skills and experience. We are not recent graduates. We are industry professionals who want to pass on our skills so that students are equipped for the workplace when they makes how to become a vocational lecturer Read technical instructors get paid significantly less than academics. scholarly promotion opportunities and ridiculously long annual leave are not part of our contracts. We are placed in the same union as call workers and security staff. We are in a lower social class than our academic I mention that we have a different management structure from the entire academic This means that we get shown the qualitative data from the National Student which points to the technical team as the strength of the year after year. when I asked the academic manager to see the I was told it would a lot of before I could see it. The thing we do see as we have ways to circumnavigate the system. We understand that really means trying to withhold negative comments about some of their staff. Plus a bit awkward if it points to our technical team as a strength in the teaching and as we are paid significantly less than does sound a bit like and some people clearly know the difference between the two. I am referred to as a technician on a daily basis. I can only assume this word association is why we are the first port of call whenever there is a technical problem with something like slides. They call on us with teaching of although this would actually be more appropriate. After a lot of us are fellows of the Higher Education Academy and have far more teaching experience than a lot of am usually the first person through the door in the morning and the last to leave in the evening that is what happens when your hours are automatically technical support hours. Students know where we are based and we spend a lot of time talking them through queries. At the end of my teaching I have a queue of students waiting at the door to ask questions. Your lecturers are on strike because they are struggling to survive Read of these sessions are written by with no input from any course academic. They are steeped in psychology and practice. But this is not teaching. I wonder about the elephant in the room. You find surgery being taught to medical students by someone who had never worked as a surgeon. But you do get academics who have never worked a day outside of HE teaching subjects. got a huge amount of respect for many of my academic colleagues who work tirelessly. But I also see the ones that let the side are plenty of new training courses offering diplomas in the same subjects as our degrees. They have partnerships with industry as well. They are busy and even though they charge more than us. Their technical are called is a massive challenge ahead of us regarding the traditional models of courses and accreditation. The sector needs to appropriately and reward the those who make a difference in the classroom. is not a dirty word in industry and it should not be in higher education. Having two disjointed teaching teams is unhelpful and creates another political minefield that students have to navigate. There should be one equal teaching team made up of different academic technical industry practitioners and talented classroom teachers. Students would have one port of leading to better communication and a better overall experience. If we sort this one we will be able to trump any other new training institution. How could they compete with that breadth of recently deceased futurist illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and but those who cannot and It is about time universities do a bit of unlearning and let everyone relearn as a the higher education network for more analysis and job direct to your Follow us on Twitter And if you have an idea for a please read our guidelines and email your pitch to us at Education

He has made that clear. He just agrees with them on some or claims to. I think the first half of term will go very badly for the voters will become and the midterm elections in 2018 will be disastrous for them. Democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of Congress. get a new supreme court but not worried about whether be too conservative. I would be more worried that they be qualified. In the long I have believe in checks and voted for Voted shortly after polls open on and I voted for Trump No disrespect intended to the third party but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either Trump or So I was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook. I chose to vote for the incompetent. In the end it the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that and would modify the impending chaos. The system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter Trump than Trump has already lost substantial support among the So he count on either the existing supreme court or Congress to ignore there is the press. What we see is a press overwhelmingly A vote for means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of potential malfeasance. Nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter in any meaningful way. So I voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without establishment underestimated the voted for I think all astounded. Instead of predictable fifth facing nobody quite knows what. I never thought this was a serious possibility until but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the Since the primary was rigged against the only major this was the next prominent way to give the Democrats a heave. else refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on not exactly shocked at but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the duopoly or help the Greens reach federal funding levels. The impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the status quo more than an actual endorsement of racism or but the forces unleashing are volatile and damn scary. As the bigger struggle starts after voting. Positive change only comes from public so arguably a better chance for it now than under a Democratic president. If no actual policy coming from the Oval space for saner voices to shape it. be but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back.

The fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done. It should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe. I know the cold fear you are experiencing. The only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed.

The racist won. The misogynist won. The xenophobe won. I guess the moral of the story trust the not even and experts beyond my station will be dissecting this for years to come and there will be questions. How did the Republican party allow that reprobate to hijack Did the media in their quest for ratings become unwitting dupes providing thousands of hours of free and unfiltered missing opportunity after opportunity to fact the blame game to commence. And plenty of blame to go around. As for I blame the Democratic party. I blame I blame The Republican party has become the party of fascists. The Democratic party has become the new Republican party.

So ruling classes have lost to a billionaire who plays at being a man of the people. Trump ran against the hierarchy of his own without the blessing of commentators or the big without the speeches to Wall Street or the funding from Silicon Valley. Amid all the justifiable dismay expressed forget one was the establishment it was Trump who ran as the perennially election night 2016 as it happened Read remains an almost illicit a preference you express in hushed tones. Look at the placards brandished last night by members of the Just over a month I rang round Trump voters in West and two of the states that went red last night. Among the things that struck me most forcibly was how sheepish they were about admitting publicly they were going to vote for the man. a but one began. think a total but back him. But who else is But had enough. That was the tenor of nearly all the conversations with a few citizens of one of the noisiest democracies on Earth then asking if I could keep their identities let me add another but. Trump is an outsider politician leading an insurgency of outsider the white men who feel homeless in their own country and the and states that got written off by both parties but that produce outsider policies. A good chunk of the Trump base consists of people who consider themselves to be losers from four decades of political and economic orthodoxy. But J Trump be the president who reads the last rites for for the simple reason that the narcissist has no idea what to replace it with. A revolt a revolution. The head prefects in our politics and media see disorder and immediately cry the mainstream view. Among the prefects of political and economic the standard thing to do this morning is to rehearse fury at free to look at the voters that most of them have never bothered talking to and to squawk that has struck out in a new and radically different direction. a The pitchforks finally have their Trump edged towards the one of the first emails I got was from a senior fund manager at the giant Fidelity are heading into a world of unprecedented political risk which calls into question the pillars of the At least as far as the economics that is just overheated it ignores just how protean politics are. This is the man who just a few months ago in an meeting at the New Times told senior journalists that is This is the Republican warrior whose most memorable photo is of him and his new wife laughing along with his guests Bill and This is the who help contradicting himself. Take out the exaggerations and outright lies from the standard Trump riff and you have next to nothing. All this makes him easily containable for the Republicans in the Senate and the House that need to work with . Twitter How the 2016 US election night the head boys and head girls also miss is just how is. Look at the people around him. Among his top economic advisers is from the Heritage a conservative last seen laying down many of the policy planks for Sure the policies are pure slashing red tape and business major tax on a repeal of estate taxes and a hankering for high interest rates and sound sort of will cost trillions up to over the next according to some They will rip a hole through US public finances especially if Trump brings them in alongside his spending spree on infrastructure. But his promise now is the promise that was made by his adviser and the rest of the it will bring in more tax revenue over the long of this will be much help for his voters. But then the property billionaire into sharing out the encouraging trade unions or paying workers more. It so long ago that he claimed wages were before and tweeting that middle classes have had effective raise in years. His latest position is that would like to see an increase the minimum of some magnitude. But rather leave it to the Gee Trump wins US offers congratulations live Read can see the paradox. Much of base was voting against the great of social contract. They were rebelling against and its love for Wall Street over Main its property boom and industrial bust. Yet what about to get is more from a man whose glory years were the years. When that work the new president will retreat further into his rhetoric. If he need script he can borrow some from the new revolt a revolution. The head prefects in our politics and media see disorder and immediately cry insurrection. what they did in after the vote and how mark 20 the date of President inauguration. Just as they called those events so call the aftermath can overdo the but at least agree that and share the same common a large chunk of the public had enough of the failed a technocratic elite that also knows no longer working and a political class unable to grasp any real elections

But the real fault lies with the owners who seem to be acting like spoiled wreaking havoc on the company they founded. and R. founded in their dorm room when they lived together while attending New business school more than two decades ago. The company is owned 50 percent by Ms. and 49 percent by One percent of the company is held by mother to qualify the business as a majority business. Since 1992 the company has blossomed and is now probably worth more than billion. has more than 3,500 and annual revenue has reached nearly million. The which is based in New has become a leading provider of translation services. While has the relationship between Ms. and has as is detailed in the decision. They were briefly engaged in but Ms. broke it off the next year. According to Ms. showed a pattern of terrorizing behavior toward the man she eventually the court said. But Ms. and stayed with the company as executives and Here is where it got complicated. They never did the most basic thing entrepreneurs do when they form a company draft an agreement that details how decisions would be made and what would happen if there was no agreement. In the latter there is typically a a mechanism that allows either party to exit by offering to sell his or her shares to the other at a set price. Ms. and failure to do this most basic thing would haunt them through this day and lead to litigation in multiple states. Without an agreement on how to run the the two were deadlocked. mother voted with not surprisingly. And the mantra that is other clearly applies to The two tried to arrange a working peace by governing separate but as the court opinion there were and by Ms. and where each would hold things up that the other wanted unless he or she got certain things. For when Ms. questioned plans to open an office in sent a number of emails threatening to dismantle the company. YOU TO MAKE ME GO NUCLEAR OVER A office decision is not one you should take You get the idea. In 2012 things got worse. According to the opinion by Chancellor G. of the Court of Ms. and would make decisions for the business but the other would then refuse to allow the decision to proceed unless he or she got something else. Ms. hired lawyers to advise and secretly hacked her emails to read them. The court has sanctioned him for it. The bickering escalated. In after an argument in the office. filed a complaint with the police against Ms. accusing her of battery and describing her as his former something that would ensure an arrest. The charges were but filed a tort case that according to the court. The court said employees made a because of the arbitrary occurring. With all the litigation was inevitable. The strategy of each party appears to be to buy out the other. But in where is there is a special provision of the law to appoint a custodian of the business if there is deadlock. The Chancellor found that the deadlock in the case met that standard. But he also found that the and utter should not justify keeping the parties in place with the business run by a custodian. This would require Ms. the most likely to sell her shares at a discount since he rational person would want to step into shoes to partner with someone willing to constant and the to get his appointing a tiebreaker director would be inappropriate because both parties were relatively young. Chancellor ordered the company sold and the proceeds split among the partners. The reaction has been heated. has appealed. A group of employees that says it represents both the and forces also has started a campaign to get the decision overturned. The employees have formed for arguing that the decision is unprecedented because is a very profitable and successful business and that a sale would cause turmoil. the leader of the predicted that half the employees would be fired if a private equity firm took over. But change is and the business may or may not prosper under a new owner. The group has also submitted to newspapers and proposed an amendment to law. One employee has sued Chancellor in New federal court claiming the decision silenced his right to speak against the sale. The Citizens for is trying to frame this as an issue of a court interfering with a and has even persuaded W. to side with it. The group has clearly gotten under the skin of the judges. Vice Chancellor also of the Chancery it is utter fabrication and ridiculous He you have here is someone outside the judicial to influence supposed to be a disinterested court But be real. The founders decided to incorporate in and judge here is applying the law. Given the childish behavior of both he is on good grounds. It seems highly unlikely that the higher court will overturn this. The legal fees would be much better spent counseling traumatized employees or going to charity. The founders chose to not settle their arrangements upfront and then bullied each other and employees in a vicious power struggle. I like to say in my classroom that a business is like a marriage where you your arrangements through a prenuptial agreement. This is one that has become an ugly divorce where not about me winning but you losing. The aggrieved employees of should not blame the judge but instead the founders who seem to have succeeded despite themselves. It is really their fault and a problem they can easily fix by behaving. There is a lesson here for too. Remember that like a get your affairs in order when you start a or you might pay.

Then imagine you were a had repeated chances to ask the next president of the United States about this and decided to not do apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated. But the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of Trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future failure was most apparent during the presidential where hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to Trump or on climate change. It was left to Ken he of the red sweater and brief to come closest with a question about coal consequences of unchecked climate which is essentially what Trump proposes by denying the problem dwarfed every other issue including emails discussed during the debates. And yet it raised. It was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with and in 1942 and not asking them about the change was also missing in broader coverage of the especially on cable where scientific emergencies make good fodder for breathless journalism. The public were periodically warned that the seas are eating away east coast and that no not just it really is warm this but climate change was treated as a side issue rather than being central to every energy and foreign policy question the country is grappling with. a leading climate is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. just baffled by To be many also skirt around climate change even if they are concerned about it. Nearly of say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them according to the Program on Climate although few people talk about the issue with family or friends. are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but a clear political divide about how to approach climate change. Polling by the Pew Research Center shows half of supporters cared about climate change a great compared with of Trump supporters. Maybe now that the reality of the next four years of president Trump is sinking a more considered view of the problems faces will take hold. Maybe people will realize important that left it to the very last minute to cut greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do this will probably risk their prosperity and national security. Maybe the spread of disease and the rising seas will be grasped as something to be urgently remedied before tropical advance further and south is inundated. There is much detail to work both on the impacts of climate change and how policies will influence them. The has promised to withdraw the US from the climate to scrap the Clean Power slash funding for renewable energy and somehow attempt to reboot the ailing coal industry. How far he will go with this and indeed how invested he personally is in it beyond outlandish tweeted is still unclear. Exiting the accord will require a notice period but as the agreement is beyond its goal of avoiding dangerous global Trump could simply drop any attempt to cut emissions and sit it out as other countries try to suppress their panic as to what to do now that the US a climate leader anymore. Trump wants to accelerate domestic coal and gas production to achieve energy but this goal is contradictory and barely feasible given the unfavorable economics facing coal and oil in particular. The new president also wants to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency while having water and clean air. He has spoken admiringly of natural beauty but has surrounded himself with fossil fuel billionaires and lobbyists who want to split open public lands for their enrichment. Republicans largely support this stance but at the same time they want a public enraged by degraded national parks or another Flint water for example. Untangling these contradictions and what they mean for the and the will arguably form the most important legacy left by a Trump presidency. up to the media to start helping do

Just a week to go. The overwhelming sense I get from people here in is that they just want it to be over. Their impatience just election fatigue feels like a kind of nervous exhaustion brought on by the clear fragility of the whole enterprise formerly known as democracy. But the other thing since the email leaks on is that Democrat supporters are abandoning the notion that victory will be a formality and are now trying to get their heads around the possibility of a Trump victory. With all the drama and hoopla possible to lose sight of the fact that after eight years of may now be set for another milestone with the election of its first female president. The fact that it has achieved this later than many other western amid a campaign seeped in misogyny and should not detract from the fact that it is happening.

Anyone who lived through the of when it took until for a winner to be declared and only then by a ruling of the supreme court will know that a presidential contest does not always produce a at least not right away. But one thing will certainly be over and that is the sometimes saga that has been the 2016 is standard to describe a US presidential contest as bitter and divisive.

Twitter search for successor has been a horror show of bullying and the bigotry. a crowded the 2016 campaign stands out as unusually awful. it has been whether followed from a distance or covered up close.

Except no drama would have dared offer this cast of characters a tycoon with a crush on a an investigated for an underage a former Miss Universe humiliated as or the reversals of fortune. Campaign 2016 has made House of Cards look that cannot conceal the the search for successor has been a horror revealing and dredging up a stew of misogyny and casual violence bubbling below the surface of life. Eight in 10 US voters say the campaign has left them feeling according to a Times poll last week. Not dissatisfied. . The platonic ideal of an election is a sober discussion of the questions that will confront the US over the next decade. The reality has been a marathon of threat and Trump poses the greatest threat to all our futures Letters Read blame for this belongs to one man. Trump has fought a presidential campaign like no other. He has mocked opponents for their belittled disparaged war damned ethnic and other minorities in bigoted jeered at disabled beaten his chest with bellicose promises of violence that would trample on the US constitution and trigger a third world and told dozens and dozens of lies every day. While his opponent has offered detailed and substantive policy those have barely got a knack for hogging media usually by saying or tweeting something has left no room. In the hours of formal presidential debates between Trump and climate change was discussed for not one Trump does not bear the blame alone. Also shamed by the 2016 campaign are those institutions and individuals who failed to stand up to him. Some understood the danger he seeing in him a dictator alone can fix whose contempt for basic democratic from the importance of a free press to the need to respect the outcome of a democratic suggested a lurch towards fascism. That small handful will be remembered with admiration. whatever the outcome historians of the republic will judge harshly those who did not stop Trump when they could. It will damn those who pampered and enabled him to reach this where polls still show him with a albeit to the White House. Twitter Bush was among the Republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with Trump. in this of shame is the Republican party. Among those hanging their heads should be the 16 rival candidates who allowed themselves to be steamrollered by a reality host and serially bankrupted businessman. and the others had no idea how to deal with Trump. They collectively made a strategic error by failing to their primary task was to take him out. they fought each each hoping to emerge as the candidate around whom Republicans would unite. That proved a poll lead increased in late 2015 and early his rivals grew ever more frightened of taking a shot at anxious that they might alienate his supporters that he might train his fire back on them. So mocked on a debate stage in New in Trump could literally step back and watch only to emerge as the winner in that Republican primary a few days later. Twitter Trump rival and New Jersey governor the Republicans cannot be blamed for the weakness of the field that fought Trump for their nomination. Perhaps no traditional politician no senator or governor could take on Trump when the Republican so furious at the political were hungering for an outsider. of this this loathing of all things was itself stoked for years by Republicans and their allies on Fox News and in the rest of the conservative complex. In losing their party to the Republicans were burned by a fire they themselves had what shames them is their conduct afterwards.

Any truthful assessment of a campaign has at least to include those doing the blame surely attaches to the who let Trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway. There is no escaping the fact that north of of the US electorate have been prepared to vote for Trump despite everything that he has said and done. One poll found of own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war. They thought but were prepared to vote for him anyway. None of them will be able to among that group are evangelical people who used to say that character that the personal conduct of a candidate was crucial. Five years only of white evangelicals believed that a person guilty of personal could behave ethically in a public role. Now that figure stands at a remarkably rapid shift. It means people of supposedly deep moral convictions have been prepared to junk those beliefs just to accommodate Trump. Twitter The a Republican presidential rally in Mobile via they will have had their reasons for many an loathing of a hatred so deep it blocks or at least copious flaws.

More than of those chemical attacks have come in and around the State stronghold in northern according to the assessment by the Conflict a intelligence collection and analysis service. The which are based on local news social media and State mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict. and military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both and the State capital in coalition is concerned about use of chemical Col.

The effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land. The assessment is to be made public on The New Times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks.

The chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than shrapnel or explosives. It was unclear how the State had obtained sulfur a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application. Both the former government in and the current government in at one point possessed chemical warfare programs. Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from militant groups in for about a decade. But it is not known how the State would have obtained sulfur the officials said. Abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by during its war against in the were used in roadside bombs against forces during the occupation that followed the 2003 invasion of But officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former inventory. The attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery suggesting that the State had access and was experimenting different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals. One theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent officials say. Another theory is that the State acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt although this theory is not widely held by analysts.

How managed to lose an election to a candidate as divisive and unpopular as Trump will baffle observers and Democrats for years to come. Once the some glimpses of rational explanation may become visible. Incumbent parties rarely hold on to power after eight years in office. following was an but politics has become steadily more since and pendulums have a habit of Trump won the volatility and a common touch Read defiance of expectations has itself also become somewhat of a golden rule in politics in 2016. Written off repeatedly during the Republican and only rarely taken seriously during the general he nonetheless the same mood that led to vote to leave the Union and Democrats in 22 US states to nominate Sanders. Fairly or it is an establishment with which could not have been more closely aligned in the minds of many voters if she economy the was a phrase coined by her adviser in the 1992 election in many it ought to have helped Democrats again in 2016. helped rescue the US from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth. Unfortunately for many simply did not feel as positive. Stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters. Trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy. Despite being pushed in this direction by Sanders in the Democratic never really found a satisfactory response. Her on trade sounded and was later proved by leaked emails unconvincing at deeply cynical at worst. Neither socialism nor the homilies of Trump offered much in the way of coherent alternatives but the bottom line was that simply failed to articulate a convincing of modern capitalism. Twitter How the 2016 US election night One big problem which undermined many otherwise plausible policy positions was a lack of trust. Paid speeches to and a murky web of business connections to the family charity left many doubting sincerity on matters of money and much else. That the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the Democratic candidate until just two days before voting with a view to bring possible criminal charges for her flouting of data security laws was just the most extreme manifestation of the issue. It was damaging not just that the bungled its timing of what ultimately proved to be a investigation but because it played into the notion that the behaved as if the law did not apply to vacuum It also did not help that what was selling was mainly herself. The strongest message was that she was uniquely qualified to become president. This was largely especially when compared with the grotesquely inexperienced but big ideas took a backstage role. There was a cast of a thousand policy from tweaks to the system to a version of the Sanders college debt proposals. Few were even among supporters. Campaign slogans are notoriously vacuous. and turned out to be more of the former than the latter. Yet only really began to take shape in response to divisiveness.

The failure partly reflects a broken industry. Reaching a vast audience no longer using or even mobile voice calls with a modeling of statistical sampling has produced dangerously misleading results in elections around the world of late. But the US fortune tellers were particularly confused by the scrambled demographics of the 2016 election. Trump in many ways ran to left on some economic with a populist appeal to a growing group of unaffiliated and yet analysts continued to assume that if registered Democrats were voting or telling pollsters they were going to it meant a vote for That all changed in a ground zero for a political bombshell that will mean the US electoral map never looks the same elections

When conducted a mass hanging in August of prisoners accused of attacks in its restive western the executions were widely criticized as an egregious human rights violation. But opponents also were appalled at what came next. Videos that showed apparently coerced confessions of the prisoners interwoven with music and clips of unrelated assaults by militants of the State have been shown on state television in the months since the executions. Produced and disseminated by official media the videos contain no apologies for the mass hangings. They apparently are meant to exploit fears among the majority population about the the extremist group ensconced in and that shares antipathy for both and the West. Human rights groups say the hangings in on 2 put 20 to 25 prisoners to one of the largest mass executions ever carried out in that country.

President legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation. In his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them. The move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest. The federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a Department of Housing and Urban Development headed by On J. Trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy. While we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story. you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to And he has specifically criticized the housing rule. Known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious. Its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day. Critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market. Republicans in Congress have tried to its implementation. wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it. If he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. the president of the National Low Income Housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since The Fair Housing Act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration. The latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing. Communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated South Side nor in exclusive New City suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing. and Jack past Republican acknowledged that second implication of the law. But for much of the time since the Fair Housing Act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself. The administration rules were an effort to address that oversight. And some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it. recently told Fox News that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated Senator another Republican to include a provision in the 1968 Fair Housing Act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email. The administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council. Many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities. In the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity. The rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists. Those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency. The first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year. Before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation. Or Congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books. For all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside. That would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation. and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further. While many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today.

By declining to put up an official candidate to fight the Park the Conservative party has shown itself to be cowardly and rational. It took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest. It calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the of May and see them slaughtered. Which is what would have happened. The chances of an official candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by and Lord landing on the head of the Loch is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops. The constituency voted heavily to remain within the Union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of A candidate in the name of the party would have split the Conservative enhancing the chances of the Lib taking the seat. So cowardice and cynicism combined with this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the party is an unalloyed blessing for the former Conservative MP who is the seat in the guise of an Once upon a when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his he might have been convincing in that role. Not now. Only a few months he was the Conservative candidate for mayor of he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own but to be the for a racially charged campaign designed by the machine. Both nasty and even his was moved to publicly deplore that very occasionally in politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament. One such was Martin the former correspondent famed for his white who ran and won as the candidate against in at the 1997 election. Goldsmith is no Martin Bell. To see how truly independent he we only have to visit the website of the local party. When I checked there on the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the logo. The Goldsmith in the Park The video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party. A statement by the chairman says that association and its resources will not play a part in this before declaring that who are members of the association may well wish to support campaign and they are at liberty to do It then provides an email address for joining his from the party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his Should he be returned as an it is widely and he has not denied that he will only sit as an independent for a while after an interval he judges to be rejoining the party. If words in politics retain any Goldsmith is no independent. If he is it will be a message to May to carry on as you is a big challenge to run as a genuine because they usually compete with the logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of parties. I guess the money is no obstacle in this case. The Goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets. There is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the Conservative party. Will the machine feed him with voter This is a highly valuable especially at a when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome. It seems to be a legal area whether the party can gift him resources without it counting against the spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign starts with some significant advantages. He has a enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than 20,000 in 2015. The first opinion poll for what worth has him comfortably ahead. In an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and the seat if his party went ahead with is a paradox. This may have been triggered by the runway but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest. His Lib rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of unlike they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible Lib who came second in the seat in 2015 and held it until ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory. Cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate. It concerns some Lib that their lacks the name recognition and the experience of her but that has not prevented them from pulling off sensations before. party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard This makes sense. If they are to see a national revival from their experience at the last general a good hunting ground for the Lib is among Remain voters alienated from both a government and is split and scared about how to deal with the division between its which voted heavily for and its northern and Welsh where there was hefty support for Out. That prevents from being a clear voice for The Lib have that difficulty. They can be unequivocal opponents of hard They believe that helped them to do well at the recent where they leapfrogged from fourth place to with a swing of The swing to them from the would only have to be a higher for the Lib to take Park. Goldsmith is at odds with most of his who voted by more than two to one to remain within the Union. It is probably not to his advantage that he is so to the liking of that has stood aside from the contest and endorsed him. In such an it is of dubious benefit to be the lightly camouflaged candidate of the party and the explicit candidate of hoped that Park might be a testing ground for the idea of a between parties on the other side of the spectrum. Three relatively senior and last week jointly suggested that their party should stand aside to the chances of a on the grounds that this parliament progressives will need every vote that they can was an interesting intervention and the more so because the trio hail from different wings of the party. Their initiative might even deserve to be called quite for committing the heresy against tribal gods of suggesting that sometimes people should support a party other than their first choice. The idea has got nowhere because it received a predictably icy response from the party leadership. and his Tom agree on much. On opposing this idea they are as one. the only is one of the more eloquent advocates of deeper between parties.

This episode is a lesson to the advocates of a progressive alliance about just how hard it will be to turn the concept into something there will be and Green candidates contesting even though they stand a hope of winning. This may not ultimately matter.

He hits a ball off of and he make the play. safe at is at There is life in 1-0 bottom grounds out to third. makes it to but only on out left for the Cubs. And up to of all players. 1-0 bottom is in to run for is at the plate. After starting of takes a strike and then swings and misses and strikes out. One down. 1-0 bottom this is drama right here. One run game. vs. the heart of the order. AND IMMEDIATELY HITS A SINGLE ON THE FIRST one way to a crowd. 1-0 top who would like to remember everyone that still in the league gets his first of the World Series too. gets three sliders in a confounding everyone. Only one of them is for a strike. next pitch is a fastball called for a ball. 3-1. What a strange selection here from goes back to the fastball for the next pitch. Good call. a full count. stands and cheers. On grounds out and that the end of the offense in the ninth. Can lock this one 1-0 top gets his first World Series Shame not in easier circumstances. He manages to work a full count off of but eventually succumbs to inevitable fate by striking out 1-0 top is in the game to keep it a game. Which is also the right move here mean anything is this situation. a perennial save situation. Scratching out run against is difficult. in to face who strikes out almost immediately. 1-0 bottom falls behind 0-2 and then hits a just foul. tried to will that one fair. He strikes out on the very next pitch and it for the who are down to their last three outs. 1-0 bottom it going to for the last four outs. This is almost certainly the right move even though I know that by saying it pretty much doomed it to failure. be facing Guyer is in the game to play left moving to center. 1-0 bottom stays in to face who hits a base hit. Does this mean that going to see 1-0 bottom gets a massive ovation coming to the as he should. Shaw stays in the game. His first pitch a called strike that sure looks upstairs to me. next to pitches are off the but he gets to shatter his bat on a pop out to short. 1-0 bottom at the most interesting part of the game. is warming in the bullpen. is on the circle here to hit in is up facing who greets with two straight balls out of the zone. swings and fouls off the next pitch. 2-1. He takes whatever. a ball. On swings and fouls on back. 3-2. swings and fouls off a cutter out of the zone. Still 3-2. grounds foul. Still 3-2. What an swings and misses for out number one. 1-0 top that was quick. flies out to go 1-2-3. 1-0 top is in the right just so all caught up on the defensive readjustments. Strop gets to strike out swinging for out number two. 1-0 top in to start the top of the 8th. falls behind 0-2. tries to get to convince him that this ball hit his but no avail. He then grounds out and apparently the end of Strop is coming out of the Cubs bullpen. 1-0 bottom it matter. Shaw promptly gets to ground out to stranding acting as the most expensive at third. 1-0 bottom the Soler hits a long down to the right field wall that looks like going to go foul int the stands. Instead misjudges it in the wind and tries to make a jumping catch. Instead the ball is fair and misses it. Solder makes it all the way to third. 1-0 bottom who grounds out to who makes a play and beats to bag for out number two. 1-0 bottom Shaw is up for with now in and catching. Shaw gets to ground out to second. 1-0 bottom Ringer going in and out of a Daffy Duck impression during Take Me Out to the Ball Game so decisions seem less weird At this Bill act just kinda bums me out. like all of is his enabler. Coco Crisp single 2016 1-0 top call is upheld to the overwhelming delight of the fans in the stands. 1-0 top poor decision making their by see if that comes back to bite is now up pitching for the first pitch to is a strike and his second compels him to swing and miss. He hits a chopper that just barely handles as the ball takes a ball as it takes a tricky hop. is is a close play at the plate and could challenge it. 1-0 top review and say that the call stands so is safe. Hard to it was probably just too hard to good news for the Cubs is that Miller is officially out of the game. The bad news is that Coco Crisp that scores the first run of the game. But the other good news is that they throw out at third for the second out. 0-0 top takes ball four and the Cubs get at third in what looked like a pitch out by Smart that. going to look at it a close play. 0-0 top my Miller has a bat in his hand. Are they really going to give him a an see. he falls behind 1-1 and calls a clear strike a ball because what doing. shrugs it off and comes back with a very clear strike. 2-2. And BOUNCES the next pitch. makes it to 0-0 top lays down a bunt to get to second. Normally not a fan of bunting like but considering a scoreless game in the 7th the quality of the pitching and defense and the looming threat of in the I totally get it. 0-0 top is back out to start the 7th and welcomes him with a solid single. And we get a for When supernaturally good pitching meet supernaturally bad pitching sure took a lot of strikes to strike out 2016 0-0 bottom gets ahead of 1-2 never believe swing and misses. three in a row for Miller. Holy hell. 0-0 bottom strikes out Fowler to start the inning before I can even register that falls behind although that second ball certainly looked like a strike from here. He works his way back to get him to strike because what an Miller does. 0-0 bottom moves have been paying off all but using Miller this early feels like it could backfire. How long can they afford to ride If he has a inning it just means that the bridge to the closer gives this Cubs offense a window of opportunity late. 0-0 top falls behind 2-0 but gets to chase his way back to 2-2. On checks his swing but has no such luck on the next pitch as he swings and misses to end the inning. 0-0 top who hits a flair that takes care of. two out just like that. 0-0 top up here to start the 6th. here to face been noticeably frustrated today. That change he grounds out to of playing at are winning this one. This clinches it. 0-0 bottom makes good contact off of but it ends up landing in glove and the end of the Cubs threat. To the Email from in The Cubs infield tonight is so good it needs another name. A lot of what looks like for the Cubs has actually been phenomenal defense. 0-0 bottom is announced as a and Terry is into the game to make a change. is in for Miller coming into the game. already.

An email I received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me. The sister was dying of cancer. she asked would I respond to the word in the context of a cancer My correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her terminal state. She outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food. She described infections and the caused by edema. But then she testified to her uncanny ability brighten any with her smiles. Had I received this query while I was undergoing my first it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy. Why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for One scholar of cancer decries tyranny of that gets too many patients making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish. During the intervening I have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and have witnessed a kind of grace that I found inspiring.

Yet when bodily functions shut few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal. their sense of seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality. What might have contributed to their patent and patient And given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my could I possibly tap such Catholic and Protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous not a reward. A disposition that works to perfect the grace cannot be known or acquired through beliefs or deeds. In the the word for appears in the benediction the Lord be gracious to though the word for is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift. For believers who seek this benefit from as for nonbelievers who seek it grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable especially in troubled times. People with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving religious private breathing and body verse or mantra making or looking at listening to or making walking in communing with and alcohol or marijuana. Those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy. A zillion books offer instructions some of but the trick must consist in finding own eccentric way.

If you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and J. various you be wrong. If it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were. The temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it. Critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas. But this the candidates share the blame. I compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs. Both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy. And the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached. Using analytic tools provided by Crimson I categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets. This consisted of four broadcast three cable news National Public Radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers. I specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like Trump the Khan family and the I also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs. This list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy. The controversies received more on than their views on the economy. From until Election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email. Only 17 percent mentioned Trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy. Closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided. This was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before Director B. letter to Congress. From this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy. As for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy. The imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies. Moving one week past the video between 15 and Election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed Trump and his imbroglios. A mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned Trump and the These choices have consequences. According to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state. In mentions of Trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail. But before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign. If media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals. It might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics. To figure out if this was the I used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and Election Day. I coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television. made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did. All over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period. The content of the ads is revealing. Both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character. In the losing ads did little else. More than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions. Only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy. By 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade. Since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic. On traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals. The economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals. usually much more balance. Of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up. Whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the Trump messaging as and the news media covered it.

The race between and Trump appears to be getting even closer with just six days left before the election. An average of six different polls shows that is now just 1.7 percentage points ahead of Trump. But still a lot of variation one poll finds that is three points another finds that she is six points Trump. Both surveys were conducted after news that the justice department had obtained a warrant to investigate an aide to before which her lead was already shrinking. Twitter women stand divided over Trump and on eve of variation between polls surprising it can be explained by the fact that different polls speak to different people. For the LA Times poll which has consistently found that Trump has more national includes one black male respondent who consistently said vote for the Republican nominee. That one individual has a disproportionate impact because of a statistical process called weighting one respondent can end up representing hundreds of thousands of are current polls a good reflection of what will happen on election the answer is although they will probably be a much better indicator by the morning of 8 rather than now. email scandal will probably go down in US political history as an a news event that can cause a shift in public opinion. Those surprises which have included announcement of a halt in the bombing of North in and the news of a charge for W Bush in 2000 typically affect final outcomes all that much as the chart below shows. It compares polling a week before from election day and the morning of with the final voting outcome.

The Trump campaign may take solace in the fact that history might not be a great guide in this election. The accuracy of polling is now in doubt. More in this are faced with a choice between two of the most disliked presidential candidates in living where media reporting on polling data is continually shaping their choices.

Getting to this stage has been a memorable starting on 6 August in the extra preliminary round against Swifts. We needed a penalty to win 4-3 and that slender win has mushroomed into something very special. The logistics and arrangements put in place this week before our tie with are all new for us as a club. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. Football Focus will be live at the ground and there will be extended highlights on Match of the and something we have never been involved in something we would never have expected in 1966. I was only 16 and all my pals were around the same age. We were in awe of England winning the World Cup and would play football on the street or any empty bit of grass and it matter if it was with a tennis ball or a punctured plastic ball. Bobby and Martin Peters were heroes to us back so we went out and bought the West Ham kit and still play in those Joy of FA Cup first round memories Read things along with who was the and a guy called and we played regularly on a morning. cycle to the local park and play friendlies but at the end of the 1966 season we decided to play in the League. Gradually it has grown from now have the first a second team and 10 junior teams. We have a wonderful headquarters and which was opened by Brooking back in 2004 but this run has catapulted us from local to international have been phone calls from journalists interested in our story and requests for tickets from all over the three phones on my desk and all been going nonstop. expecting about 1,000 but unfortunately our are at home and they get crowds of so that might keep a few away from us. Even it will be our biggest day. It is made all the sweeter by the entire club being run by volunteers. Nobody on the committee gets paid and we all do it out of our love for the has been a memorable journey but we are being positive and looking to go through again. We could have lost any of those games but here and hoping to progress further.

Twitter on their way to beating at Park. FA via Town FA Cup is a big deal but I think this is the pinnacle for us because of the success the club has had in They won the FA Vase in 2013 and earned promotion last season. The main aim this season was to get promoted again but this is still a nice bonus for us. At the same time the club will gain financially and it is a nice morale boost for the lads to get through a few rounds and then to play in a big have any fear going down to from County although not sure it is as big an advantage playing them when as some people think. They are still a League One team. not mugs and it matter if they playing well. not worth our time thinking about their managerial situation and there is the risk of a backlash from too. not fancied but we just need to go and do our best and see what preparing right and down the night before. such a big everyone enjoys playing in the cup. You try to prepare in a similar way but you get a bit longsighted when the draw is made especially if you get a big actually scored in the opening qualifying a 5-3 win over Borough. I took a in my own it took a heavy bounce and went over the head of the opposing goalkeeper. Twitter scores an against first few weeks were a bit crazy after it. My phone never stopped but calmed down now. Looking back you their poor but not something that happens a lot and there was such a novelty factor about it. At the time it was when you score everyone is at the end the ball goes in celebrating but after I scored everyone came down to me. In that situation the opposition were free to when they wanted. So we were all still celebrating when the game would be nice to be celebrating again but it is going to be a big test. We be putting ourselves under any pressure because nobody expects us to advance but going to give it our best shot and hope for the Town John been a fan of Town since the so for about 60 years all in all. 74 now and say this is one of the biggest games I can remember for the been to the first round of the cup once back in the We played which I think we lost 3-1 after being 1-0 up.

We used to play local football together years ago. We usually stand in the same at the left hand side of the goal on the concrete bank. no name for the end but pretty handy for getting a cup of tea at a very good bond between players and fans here. The players go around and applaud the fans after the though I suspect the manager is probably telling them United to the first round of the FA Cup is the holy grail for our club. our objective for the season because of what it the rewards it brings. Last year we made the first round and beat Bristol Rovers. fantastic to replicate that and visit do I remember about the Bristol I remember the anticipation of going to a pro the atmosphere in the the size of the crowd.

That field is now the have anybody or anything at all at the club so when I first had to get the pitch done I used to call a farmer and ask him to cut it. As we went up the I you had to do this stuff for yourself. Later the FA emailed and said been nominated for a award and could they see my equipment. I have a lawnmower or anything but we kept a reasonable ground so we won a little award.

The space suit is only a few layers of plastic and metallic material. a very thin plastic shield covering your a few your visor. Between your body and the other side of that plastic visor is instant an amazing outside in the cosmos. Life in space is very interesting. in some ways similar to Earth busy and you have a schedule you have to follow but one overriding thing that is unlike anything on and that is weightlessness. Two crewed space stations now orbiting Earth Read is like this force. It just envelops everything. Everything floats. The instant that the rocket engines shut down on your space you were born on you had a year or two to learn how to and really three or five years to learn how to walk and run. But when an the second the engines shut you have to learn how to float. There is a steep learning most astronauts are learning for several weeks and often a month or two before you get as good as you a fun process. You move with your hands and you carry things with your which is the opposite of how we were designed on Earth. It was really for lack of a better to learn how to do food in space is actually pretty good much better than what I cook by myself. also fruit oranges they look pretty bad because kind of but they smell amazing. The space station is this sterile very plastic and metal and every never any ever messy. always like a very sterile. So great to have smells from day I was floating through and I heard a bird chirping and I the heck is and I stopped and I went back. The psychologist had sent an file with sounds from and he was listening to birds chirp while he exercised. We had a rain sound sent up and I spent about a month going to bed at night with my headset just listening to rain as I fell asleep. Twitter Moon over the South China photographed from the International Space Station. Terry weekend we took all the laptops in the station probably 20 or 30 laptops and we put rain on through and all weekend it rained. It was really cool at first but by night we were like enough so we went around and turned the rain is a big part of life in space because and when weightless your muscles and bones atrophy. So they have this exercise protocol of running on a you put on a shoulder and bungees that pull you down. The treadmill is on the wall. You have to learn how to run in this weird but over time I got to a point where I could run very which was really cool. a bike which is interesting because no handlebars and no just some pedals. You just kind of float there and and watch your show. After 200 days of more than half of a I came back to Earth and had lost of my bone density. I was amazed. To the space station had shown that humans can live and work in space for a long period of time at least 200 days and come back to Earth in great shape. While I was in passed away from Star Trek. We were doing these space three space walks in a and my friend from emailed me and gotta do something for So I ran down to the I did the I took a and I tweeted the background there is which just happens to be his home down. Terry a fighter pilot we had a rather be lucky than good. And this was an example of that. It was just completely it was not I just happened to take this picture with home town in the background. It was a wonderful piece of fate my first space I launched at four in the morning. Both my launches were at four in the morning. If ever going to a great time to go shoot for four in the the views are great. About 15 minutes later we were going over the North in the daylight and I saw this blue atmosphere. And I never seen that shade of blue never expected seeing a that I had never seen before but that was my first impression of Earth in the never seen that shade of blue Twitter seen from the International Space Station. Terry pictures of sunrises and sunsets never got but the camera does not capture them well enough. I want to learn how to paint so that I can paint what I we were in a rocket blew up the same one that launches crew. So they delayed our replacement crew while they did an investigation. We know how long we were going to be up there. But my mentality in going to enjoy and then have the rest of my life to be on Earth. And that just knowing that there would be an end to and to try to enjoy it while I you launch with a rocket filled with millions of pounds of rocket the word really apply. Even just being in space if a meteorite hits your spaceship and puts a big hole in all the air will go out. You live with the danger of that happening. In the space station there are three kinds of air leak or ammonia. And we had the ammonia alarm go off for the first time it had never happened in the history of the space station. our most serious alarm because ammonia is a very deadly chemical. They told us in you can smell worry about because going to how bad it is. That alarm went off. We spent several hours hiding on the side with the hatch closed because the use only the side does thinking that the space station was possibly dead. Had there really been an ammonia leak it would have ended while we were there. It turned out a few hours later that it was a false alarm. But that was probably one of my most scary moments. The most amazing for was the lightning on Earth. One of my things to do in space was just to float. I would go into the which is this module that I had the privilege of installing in 2010 on a space shuttle flight. I would open up all the window shades if we were passing over or because there are all these amazing thunderstorms in the Pacific too. I would put on this song called Storms of put that on the speakers and I would let go of the handles and just watching these storms. kind of hard to recreate those moments. Sleeping in space is amazing. We had a sleeping bag and we had a little like a phone booth. I would get in my sleeping bag and zip it up. I sleep with my arms some people sleep with their arms sticking up. I would pull the sleeping bag over my and then I would not myself to the wall or put on the bungee I would just float in my little cabin. And every morning I would be turned around in a because the air flow would spin me around like that. meteorite recovered from farm in Western Read were a few times in space where I of Earth. I would dream of or or weather. Weather was something that I really missed a lot. Every once in a while it was really cool to dream of just something messy because the station was so sterile or some cold rain. Anything that was not sterile.

After the homophobic attack in this the atmosphere at Pride in win. not going to stop a police constable and volunteered to be at the spoke to a lot of people in the police force about whether it was a good idea for me to do a surprise proposal to my during the parade. Everyone was so supportive. It was significant for me because I joined the police after being brutally assaulted on my 18th birthday because of a public display of affection with my secret boyfriend. It was 10 years ago and my family yet know I was gay. Both my parents are vicars and my sister had just come and it a good environment.

An inspector stopped the parade. It was all done very very I walked towards Johnny. He had no idea. I see anything but him. I hear the crowd.

thousand how much time you could potentially waste on email over the course of your working according to a recent Post article. To put that number in roughly equivalent to spending five years on the writer we spend our days of how we spend our And we are spending our days largely on email. The average office worker dips into their about 11 times an receives about 147 messages a and spends nearly of their total working week in their way to a better not Read just because spending all this time on email mean enjoying it. When I talk to people about their email the most common feelings they mention are and overwhelm certainly not enthusiasm. research shows that the more frequently we check our the more stressed out we why do we spend so much time doing something that we particularly The fact is that even though we might not care for the content of every email we many of us are addicted to the act of checking email. It activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards. And in this regard not very different from in the the psychologist BF Skinner invented a device called the conditioning now known as the Skinner which he used to test theories on rats. Skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive such as food and negative such as electric would have on the he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of reinforcement. For if the rat pressed the lever inside the it would receive a food pellet. If it continued pressing the every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet. Skinner also experimented with a variable schedule. In this scenario the rat know when the reward was coming. It might have to press the lever 20 times to get a or it might have to press the lever 186 times to get a pellet. The system was and the rat could never know exactly when the reward was the rats were significantly more motivated when they were on the variable schedule. Skinner found that even if he took away the rewards for the rats on the variable they would keep furiously pressing the lever for a very long time before giving up much in than the rats on the fixed schedule this starting to sound familiar For better or humans respond to positive rewards very similarly to rats. And as a economist who studies the irrational actions of explained to email is a random rewards of work is making us miserable. learn to live again Read of the time when you the to check your email you get something disappointing or bothersome a communication from a frustrated client or a boss with an urgent request. But every once in a while you press the lever and you get something exciting an email from a friend if really a cat video. And those random rewards that we find so addictive. They make us want to push the lever again and again and even when we have better things to it cuts both while you might get something you also might get something upsetting or And that feeling of queasy uncertainty is another aspect of strange many times have you confidently sent off a message only to find yourself just minutes over why you have not yet received a Wondering if your request or your phrasing had been received as it was Worried that you yourself should have written back said something asked for or asked for problem springs from a lack of social feedback. Normally when we communicate with someone in or even on the we are reading a thousand little social cues as we talk and deciding what to do next based on those cues. It often happens that we will start to say something but based on feedback we get from the other think better of it and take another tack. When we communicate through that social feedback loop is absent. Emails lack the facial physical and vocal tone that typically shape our interpretation of what someone is saying and allow us to adjust our delivery in order to get our true meaning results in what the psychologist calls a natural towards email. argues that if the sender feels positive about an then the receiver usually feels neutral. And if the sender feels neutral about the then the receiver typically feels negative about it. In other as if every message you send gets automatically downgraded a few positivity notches by the time someone else receives all well and you might be but what am I supposed to do about solution to our email problem lies with getting more in touch with what makes us uniquely human. Overcoming the negativity and allaying some of its attendant requires us to upgrade our empathy and enthusiasm when it comes to digital communication. To communicate more like feeling humans than impersonal robots exchanging recent study done by the people behind the Boomerang email crunched the data from millions of email exchanges and found that messages that expressed emotion were most likely to get a response. And among emails using positive words and subjective language earned the most replies. In other messages that encouraged people and expressed a point of view were the most effective. We want we want to communicate with people who are interesting and quality that separates us from animals and robots alike is the ability to set goals and pursue them with focus. As we are uniquely equipped to train our attention on a given task and keep it there to not be distracted by random rewards or false urgency or of missing To focus instead on goals and meaningful rewards. But right now we are choosing to succumb to addictive allure and to let it dictate our our and our lists at work rather than up the willpower that we know is necessary to turn our attention away from our data is clear about the drawbacks of living in email.

fashionable to dismiss all politicians as equally unprincipled or simply venal. Since the system is gridlocked and out of surely that means all just as bad as each amid the wreckage of the political Trump is different and not just because of his politics or his rhetoric. He is in a class of his taking narcissism and amorality to a whole new need a trove of leaked emails to understand just how different is. You just need to get to know the Trump Foundation a little better. Thanks to the dogged reporting of the we can do just that. not pretty reading. Trump and his supposedly charitable works are a grotesque distortion of a word whose roots come from the for loving people. Judging from his Trump mostly loves one whose name just happens to be of donating to a foundation with any meaningful Trump invested in his favorite inflating his This is his whether the Trump brand of politics or charity. The product is the an artificial version of the 1997 story of when he was principal of a public school for a day. It was a cute program designed to boost struggling schools in New and the supposedly wealthy property developer delighted in the school chess team was holding a bake sale to raise to pay for travel to go to a tournament. Trump handed them a fake bill. After making them the butt of his Trump wrote them a real check for just kind of person mocks the students he is supposed to be man who shows up a year to the opening of a nursery school for children with Trump sat on pretending to be a when he had given nothing. Not a penny. He posed for photos alongside then mayor and the developer who actually donated generously to build the school. Then he simply drove having done Trump. The man whose charitable foundation buys giant portraits of himself to hang in his own golf Post called more than 400 charities with some connection to Trump. It found just one gift from Trump in the past eight to the Police Athletic League of New for less than charity would not matter if he brag about it so much. The scrutiny began when he skipped a primary debate as part of his petty feud with Fox staging a for veterans instead. Trump promised to give to the but the money only materialized after months of media all his boasting about his most of the money came from outside not from Trump say this kind of man has no shame. and exactly how Trump has managed to get to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States of is the way he won the primaries. Where other candidates were mildly restrained in their and Trump could always take things beyond the extreme. No previously elected official could trash and demand payment for a border wall. Shameless is the way he has conducted himself as a nominee. He has picked fights with a Gold Star family and promised to lock up his political rival without due process. He has praised while attacking his opponent for supposedly jeopardizing national it turns out that a good chunk of Republicans like his shamelessness. They confuse his for the kind of free spirit that will reform a broken real reform candidate could have won this election in a landslide. A extremist could have rallied the disaffected masses to his Trump is no reformer and he has no He abused the tax system to convert corporate losses into personal tax benefits. Then he accused his rival of failing to stop his tax when she actually voted to close the very loophole that he has the scrutiny of his the long audits he suffers are entirely of his own making. Trump will no doubt cast such investigations as political long after this election is Trump is like the arch villain of a dozen superhero the more he is the stronger he gets. The only solution is the of election because with it comes the ultimate public matter how much the national polls the polls represent a disaster for Trump. States that he needs to win such as and are out of reach. States he needs to such as North remain in jeopardy. States that Republicans needed to defend in such as and are is only one refuge left for a man like the shameless undermining of the democratic process itself. He will challenge the election and its results. He will stir up conspiracies of fraudulent votes and rigged elections. He will this political leaders in ways that will make very he will walk away from the disaffected voters who believed his promise that he would win so much they would get bored of elections

President is considering removing S. Rogers from his posts as leader of the National Security Agency and United States Command after top officials expressed frustration over the speed at which Admiral Rogers had moved to combat the State and over the repeated loss of closely guarded administration and intelligence officials said J. Trump is considering Admiral who is responsible for surveillance and the growing arsenal of for a top post in his including director of national intelligence overseeing all 16 intelligence agencies. Admiral Rogers met with Trump on apparently without the White knowledge. The recommendation to remove Admiral a career intelligence officer who was promoted to his posts by the administration two years came last month from Defense Secretary B.

The effort to force out Admiral which was first reported by The puts Trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the White House is considering relieving of his posts. It also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration. Admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after Trump takes over. One senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change. Representative of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of transition strongly defended Admiral Rogers. In a letter to Carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push Rogers out. not by accident that Admiral Rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview. Carter and Clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the White House to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the Command. But there are questions inside the giant complex at Fort where the and Command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own. It relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with Admiral Rogers on at Trump Tower in New Senior Defense Department and intelligence officials were surprised that Admiral while on personal had paid a visit to Trump. first major disagreement with Admiral Rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action against was not acting aggressively enough to disrupt the networks in and In the Carter said for the first time that the United States was using its against the State. But the effort was moving too slowly for the Pentagon and Carter went to Fort several weeks ago to give Admiral Rogers and his team kick in the one official said. Top national security officials had also come to see Admiral Rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the He took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by J. the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said. That perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former T. Martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments. Martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents. Administration officials had planned to relieve Admiral Rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and Command. But the supported by Carter and stalled in part because of opposition from Senator John Republican of who heads the Armed Services Committee. Under the Command would remain under the Armed Services but oversight of the would shift to the Senate Intelligence Committee. victory complicated the planning.

A searing report by the former director of the confirmed that its athletic the head of its campus and the revered football were all exposed as having played key roles in a of crimes. Amid the the department of education quietly opened up an inquiry into whether State officials had violated the a 1990 act of Congress that requires colleges to track and publicly disclose crimes that occur on campus or in the vicinity. But of all the investigations into said it may be this one that has the greatest implications for other schools which mishandle cases of sexual misconduct. The significance is in the sheer breadth and detail of the investigation. Whereas previous education department probes have covered only a few years of alleged the duration of crimes forced investigators to search for Act infractions dating all the way back to concluded that State had committed 11 different violations from 1998 to ranging from a failure to maintain a daily crime log to a failure to issue timely warnings about a crime to the campus community.

Voters under the age of 30 voted for by an margin. young are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older there is a gender though smaller than many expected. Despite accusations from 15 women that Trump or assaulted and a recording of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting he only lost the female vote by 12 points the same margin by which he won the male and approximately the same margin by which beat and among women. White women even favored Trump by 10 and white women without a college degree by an astonishing 28 points. misogyny dissuade women from voting for him. They normally favor Democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about 20 points more than men. also the margin by which women are more concerned about climate change than did elect and then important to remember that as with Gore in more voted for than her victorious opponent. Gore received about a half million more votes than W. Bush. will likely receive over a million more votes than Trump. Bush and Trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college the popular vote was closer in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008. Republican voters were willing to forgive many disqualifying flaws. They care about his constant lies. per cent of evangelicals voted for Trump despite his long history of immoral behavior. But many voters willing to overlook the scandal of emails. And much of support was concentrated in areas like my home state of where she won by over 28 while enough rural white Trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and electoral college votes.

New legal guidance for universities on how to deal with alleged student misconduct including violence against harassment and hate crimes has been issued by Universities the umbrella for sector and a welcome step sex abuse report fails to tackle staff attacks on students Read the first it that universities themselves can initiate disciplinary action for possible criminal and can also impose precautionary such as the exclusion or suspension of an accused problem is that the guidance applies to a multitude of crimes and one size does not fit all. The issues that arise in relation to allegations of theft or criminal damage are very different from those that relate to sexual definition of guidance states that it is and for a university to make a finding of and states that alleged will be in a disciplinary process. This is technically correct. A university cannot find anyone guilty of the criminal of as it is not a criminal court. the example sets out misconduct as intercourse without which is in essence the definition of in determining the alleged facts and matters albeit to a lower threshold of proof than in a criminal the disciplinary panel is in effect called to determine whether it is more likely than not that a rape occurred. The facts of the case will be the same whether it is called rape or are left in the difficult position of having to investigate and gather evidence as to whether the rape happened. And they are not given any further guidance as to what constitutes appropriate evidence. Nor are universities guided as to who should gather evidence and exactly what training such an investigator should for in order to satisfactorily question about that in very many rape and sexual assault cases the issue is not if the incident occurred but whether or not it was it is very likely that and then disciplinary will find themselves having to assess the credibility of conflicting was being but my university refused to protect me Read is here that I think there is most cause for concern.

For Democrats over the age of a heartbreaking loss in a presidential election is an uncomfortably familiar feeling. Twice in the past two Democrats have won the popular vote but lost the presidential loss brings three intertwined questions. What the best way to deal with the new And the path back to power in the next midterm and presidential cabinet several key posts decided as it happened Read result is so different that each of those questions is perplexing. The underlying cause of the defeat might be that Democrats lost their connection to white particularly in the upper Or that some time in early lost her longstanding base of popularity and trust and equipped to get it back. There are a dozen or more demographic categories in which in in addition to white people without college suggesting that broad unpopularity was an inescapable to a volatile base of cultural disconnect and raw dishonesty about what a president could achieve for Trump and his sometimes unwitting allies added relentless but baseless director letter 10 days before the election announcing that he was reopening the investigation into email practices. came of These staggering interventions went well beyond the mild constitutional crisis that led to W yet won the popular vote and not by a little but by about more than the proportions enjoyed by several recent presidents. The Trump coalition is smaller than former Republican presidential nominee Mitt from 2012 and a minority of voters supported Republican House and Senate overall.

And so we should not be surprised that they have started out on an uncertain footing on the second of how to relate to the administration. The norms that have been violated are so many and so and the risks so that the only moral reaction is to refuse to the most overused word in the abrupt arrival of with a in the democracy that anchors the world order. And however correct that it is largely meaningless in action.

Some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in China is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land An entirely I will but my This excellent panel give us measured hope for the future. 22 2016 many countries afraid it will not possible. We often forget Central and West where elephants are in many areas doomed. If we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the Eastern and Southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people. 22 2016 but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now. But there is real 22 2016 think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained. They might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin. Current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities. 22 2016 I think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened. And I strongly believe that if we don't want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next 5-10 years while we have something to work with. This applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week. For all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with We need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat. elephants are whose Elephant Family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future. 22 2016 the past 100 years of elephant populations have been wiped out.

It's remarkable how well they've done in and when you think of the population pressures. it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done. Says 22 2016 we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat. We can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely. We can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the So there IS but we need to act now. as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam. Our biggest project at the moment with other is our Corridors Campaign. On asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says 22 2016 there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it's simply a drop in the ocean. There are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism. And you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc. a huge Human Toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it. 22 2016 the same situation in Even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number. Whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says Hedges. 22 2016 the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas. Corruption is sometimes a problem too. Governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations. You are correct to say that in can generate see the paper I referenced Weaver G. C. Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps. 22 2016 think community needs are greater than the support they are especially in many but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own. In the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most people live. They may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them. So I don't think elephant populations always need to for through trophy hunting or tourism income. But I think that better access to development or government aid or even an farming and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities. Those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach. Strong communities are a very important part of this and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent interaction. Stiles says this is already underway in 22 2016 is a critical question and in right now there is a group doing exactly planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies. All range states should conduct such including corridors And Hedges agrees. 22 2016 Elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation. In of habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to which are now largely confined to protected many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge problems on their borders. Maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential. as notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as and but much more needs to be done in many more places. For those feeling far away and here are some concrete actions you can take today. 22 2016 agree with lobbying governments. These should be considered World Heritage Animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards Forest and Wildlife Departments. Stronger departments aid better resource and not only help provide stability but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife. Preventing environmental damage of silting of polluted water which communities later. I also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions. say most panelists. Although there are some caveats. 22 2016 think the quote is the Mother of applies here. Some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community not just wildlife Stiles says it could work for some species. But not elephants. 22 2016 not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving at least elephant maybe other species. It's a complicated from Elephant Action League 22 2016 hunting is often the of government that do not want to protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic Hedges agrees complicated. But also perhaps an issue by both advocates and relative to its potential impact. 22 2016 I would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging attitudes among local people. Trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in difficult places where there are few other options for Trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used. But in some places trophy hunting operations have predator introduced or bred trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation. it's complicated. It is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation. The amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in and so in some ways the heated debates are a distraction from the bigger issues. Hunter Life after global outrage into funding for conservation in Conservation Letters 296-301. has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so Stiles 22 2016 the demand where consumers law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails. If shops are closed traders and consumers move to websites and members only social media. Demand must be but this is a long of Elephant Family points 22 2016 the words of a wildlife enforcement illegal investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter states and There's a need to this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led. Customs have demonstrated they have mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date. Many techniques still aren't being such as controlled forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to and lack of proactive responses. Sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually yet such a deterrent barely Hedges of 22 2016 is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting change not just raising we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date. But demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of so we know it can be done. Elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to according to the panel. Consultant Stiles says we can only control how humans respond. 22 2016 those who suffer the depredations of the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits. Very few places have mechanisms in place for that have to involve says Wildlife 22 2016 between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided. However solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife. Innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously can't take a top down they have to build economic says Hedges in a comment too long to post so link to it here. He also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans. 22 2016 addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever a key part of mitigating conflict or conflict more generally is to adopt a sound approach to testing and promoting effective reduction methods. There are methods that can help reduce some circumstances at out there but they need to be deployed more effectively. Approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too. Most including Hedges from agree that the mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory 22 2016 I think the Government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in China. That commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from President Xi and President in 2015. Earlier this year the authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the so we can expect to see that announcement points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago. 22 2016 this is Govt hasn't announced a even though Hong which is 2020. Can we be sure that China is serious about even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the of points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as China. 22 2016 the ending of the domestic legal trade in whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in China that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results. China often resists legislation for as long as then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high. But that is not the same as effective enforcement. China is a very big reach is less effective than many outsiders and enforcement may not be a priority. If you look at the overall movements in the relatively recent surge in demand from for both ivory and rhino I suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into China it's a change of route rather than a drop in who works with the elephant specialist believes some news might be imminent. 22 2016 heard they will announce the plan in It will involve a phased allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their as Hong has done Before our panel convenes at here is some reading material that could provoke thoughts and founder of Wild on the drawbacks of exclusive protected zones and outlines a different mode of can save elephants.

The number of articles discussing the teaching excellence framework now easily eclipses the official government documentation describing it. People are bashing praising arguing about the metrics it and prophesying about how it will shake up higher education for good. university reporters and government officials are all weighing in. Everyone has something to say about how the will change student life for better or it except the undergraduate students it is supposed to benefit. Stand at the lectern in any lecture hall and ask the assembled students what the is. I doubt many will some would argue that student voice is through the National Union of Students and who did respond to the consultation. But these rightly or have condemned the higher education bill and the outright because they see it as a back door to higher fees. The NUS are threatening a boycott and spoiling of the National Student Survey key as a protest. They recently have won some concessions in the Higher Education but the is going ahead a survey revealing that students are not very enthusiastic about the they do care deeply about quality teaching. University found that out in 2013 when they tried to sack an lecturer who was loved by students and had won teaching awards. found the same thing when its open day was disrupted by angry students who when it rejected a masters program on whiteness led by and ended his contract.

The Department for Education and universities should develop a feedback in collaboration with current that future students could regularly contribute identifying weaknesses in teaching and offering strategies for improvement. Students could then give a single set of numerical scores measuring quality and response to feedback that feed directly into providing a regular student appraisal of departmental excellence.

THANK YOU FOR BEING Guide to Thriving in the Age of L. pp. From Trump to to Marine one thing that unites the unhappy West is a profound sense of mystification. Across and North people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why. There is no narrative. Hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the Union. But what most people really crave is an honest explanation. As with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong. Then you can decide on the medication. Into this darkened room steps Tom While other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news L. is a whose goal is to be a from to And he is extremely good at it. A talent for explanation has garnered him a column at The New Times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change. Snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people. Now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto. You for Being has two overt aims. wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in. And then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be In general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance. But as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat. argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature. The problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change. That sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one. For on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the Android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the 1971 Beetle would travel at 300,000 miles per cost 4 cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime. The chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets. But also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another. In climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children so a population of 19 million will reach 72 million hungry people by 2050. On trading technology and markets create so a operating out of his flat by can make the index fall 9 percent in a And will keep getting faster. There are already at least 10 billion things connected to the but that is still less than 1 percent of the possible total as ever more gadgets and bodies join of Man has sped up his own response times. It now takes us only 10-15 years to get used to the sort of technological changes that we used to absorb in a couple of but what good is that when technology becomes obsolete every five to seven The supernova is making a joke of both patent law and education. companies and individuals are all struggling to keep up. It can be bewildering even for the winners like himself. In he was queuing up to phone his stories from telephone now he can email a column from deep in that appears almost instantaneously on the Times website and provokes a rapid reaction from China. In two and a half years researching this he had to interview all the main technologists at least because things changed so quickly. Like everybody he has no time to The title comes from an offhand comment to a friend whose tardiness allowed a few welcome minutes of contemplation. For the most You for Being is a master class in explaining. It canters along at a pace that is quick enough to permit learning without getting bogged down. Inevitably he sometimes gets the balance either allowing his informants to ramble or skating over a thorny For having admitted that productivity numbers have not forward in the same way that technology he asks in to trust they will. the folksiness will still irk some The starting point for the book is a chat with a parking with another attendant from waiting near the end. But criticizing for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that used sex to sell It is what he does well. There is also a value in bringing things together in putting foreign policy beside climate change. And be fooled by the catchy slogans not into and so As usual with it is all backed up by pages of serious reporting from around the world. this complaint is that the explaining is too convincing. Lying on the listening to him in his guise as Tom you ever more the reasons the world is spinning so fast. It is not all Along the way we discover that the created more teller jobs at banks it allowed banks to increase the number of There are inspiring stories of communities rising to the and a memorable paean to the virtues of chickens from Bill Gates empower keep children healthy and But respite from these There is there is not going to be and attempts to stop it all will do more damage than good.

If the politicians in accomplished even a quarter of his the United States would be better at coping with change. But is too honest a reporter to argue that will happen soon. Asked why some biological systems the environmentalist are all highly adaptive and all the rest is It is hard to put in the highly adaptive category. main cause for optimism is based on a trip back to St. the suburb where he grew up. This is perhaps the most memorable part of the book a piece of sustained reportage that ranks alongside to masterly first book about the Middle East. He points out that the same communal virtues that made work when he was young have survived and are still useful. But the passages that lingered with this reader were the ones about the good old days that have disappeared when baseball used to be a sport that everybody could afford to when local boys like the young could caddy at the United States when everybody in town went to public schools. So you finish this book thinking everything is going to be for the unhappy West that can dance in a There is no easy pill to and most of the ones being proffered by the extremists are poison. But after your session with you have a much better idea of the forces that are upending your how they work together and what companies and governments can do to prosper. You do have a coherent narrative an cohesive explanation for why the world is the way it without miracle cures or scapegoats. And that is why everybody should hope this book does very well indeed.

My boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can I do about boss like me. not sure why and have given up trying to figure it but making my working life miserable. She undermines me in front of the rest of the interrupts with irrelevant asides when trying to lead leaves me out of meetings I should be included and makes threats that I might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if I do some often irrelevant task.

If she senses you it will give her still further pleasure and even see it as in some way justifying her would hope that those in authority will soon the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her.

Wrestling with a difficult some big law firms are demoting partners meaning they are no longer owners in the firm who share in annual profits. The latest to publicly weigh such a step is a powerhouse New firm that indicated recently that it would revamp primarily through demotions and delays in promotions to full partnership status. or even partners is not new in the legal industry. A decade the efforts at Sterling to jettison unproductive partners were called But it is a tool the legal industry once wielded sparingly. back now because there is a growing recognition that demand for legal services is not picking up and firms are facing overcapacity said Peter a law firm consultant. Some firms have been quietly weeding their partner ranks as a result. In a process called law firms set retirement dates for certain equity partners or reduce them to salaried cutting them out of the yearly profit distribution. Such demotions take a heavy toll personally and financially. One who graduated from an Ivy League law school in recalled that her own experience was dismaying and disorienting. After a decade of law firm and government she made partner at an elite firm but was nudged out the door a few years later. It she the first negative feedback she had received from her fellow partners. A feeling of loss stuck with her after her she said. The lawyer said that she had to start her career taking a job that was more junior and at lower pay. She agreed to tell her story on the condition that she and her former firm not be fearing that her professional reputation and livelihood would be seriously harmed as a result. Not all lawyers leave. The number of partners at the 200 largest law firms in the country has more than tripled to an average of 117 per firm in 2014 from an average of just 35 in said D. a principal at a legal consulting firm. And not all partners are the result of reductions in rank. Some lawyers choose it so they do not have to invest capital in the firm typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or risk partnership liability if someone sues the firm.

Last ownership partners worked an average of 87 hours annually more than partners up from 64 hours more five years according to a sample of 40 of the largest 50 firms. Putting colleagues out on the or even packing them off to a smaller is not easy. And firms are loath to draw attention to such moves for fear of damaging their prestige and their ability to attract new business. too many according to a study by political and cultural obstacles are hindering pragmatic economic including ousting lawyers who are not needed or not attracting lucrative legal work. the winnowing of partners who can take home hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in annual compensation is taking place more frequently.

He would not say whether his office was looking into accounting practices. A spokesman for said the office did not have any agreements with cooperating witnesses to make public at this time.

In when the Gender Identity Development Service at Clinic it received two referrals in its first year of operation. As current director of the it was considered a option for a clinical psychologist to in the field of gender identity in young people there enough patients. That is not how it has turned out. Last 1,400 children under 18 were referred to double the number the year before. Of these nearly 300 were under the age of with some as young as three years reasons for this exponential increase are obviously complex. One factor seems to be a huge shift in awareness of individuals in wider culture. The attention paid to in and a Carter playing a role in the historic tragedy of the story told in and the many public controversies about respect for trans rights have all informed this awareness. It is never just a phase. if these kids do go through self has helped to open up a space for greater acceptance and particularly in but also for highly emotive and debate about how best to help young people who believe they need to transition. At the sharpest end of this debate are the parents whose children are identifying themselves as well before and sometimes living outwardly as the other sex. These children and their parents are more aware than ever that there are choices available to them to correct what they believe to be the error in their bodies. It can seem these choices are the ultimate but the decisions parents have to make about intervening in their biology are anything but couple of weeks ago I sat in on a conference by a charitable support group for parents of children who identify as trans. The charity has been much in the news in recent in part because it has featured in the widely reported custody battle heard at the High Court that involved a boy of seven allowed to live as a because his mother had become convinced those were his wishes. The judge in the Justice ruled that the boy should live with his and that the mother caused significant emotional harm to her son in her active determination that he should be a Mermaids had supported the mother in her belief that her son identified as for two years and described the ruling as a injustice and which had been for the another case it was reported that a family was taking legal action against a local authority for backing their adoption of a name as a step towards changing her gender.

Digital Art Bell S went along to the Mermaids conference in part to try to make sense of some of these issues for myself. It seems to me unquestionably a wonderful thing that young people faced with some of the trauma of these feelings about who they are can find tolerant space in which to experiment with different expressions of their gender and be protected in law from discrimination. But as a I find it hard to get rid of the feeling that the more choices you give to younger the more they are likely to adopt them for a variety of psychological reasons.

The number of complaints coming into the public office is five times the normal and the pace has only just recently tapered off. My colleague who oversees the letters to the says the influx from readers is one of the largest since Sept. 11. Many people are commenting on the but many are venting about The coverage.

The paper says quite the opposite is the It reports having the largest subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay in 2011. I assume that The Times has more accurate data than Trump. But I hope any chest thumping about the impressive subscriber bump obscure a look at coverage. Because from my conversations with and from the emails that have come into my I can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage. Readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from The Upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that had an 80 percent chance or better of winning. They complain that The attempt to tap the sentiments of Trump supporters was lacking. And they complain about the liberal tint The Times applies to its without awareness that it does. Few could deny that if more moderate supporters are feeling bruised right the blame lies partly with their candidate and his penchant for inflammatory rhetoric. But the media is at fault for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him. What struck me is how many liberal voters I spoke with felt too.

No one could see him. So he headed to the nearest emergency room. On the he called his insurance company to make sure the visit would be covered. Once he got to the Palms of Hospital emergency a doctor gave him some medication and and let him go. A month feeling better and back at home in Baton received an bill from the doctor who treated him for really makes me and kind of breaks my he said. When people go to the emergency they are often stunned to discover that doctors who treated them are not employed by the hospital and bill their insurance company separately. These doctors negotiate separate deals with insurance companies for payment. If the doctor and the insurance company never strike a the visit is billed at much higher rates. While the insurance company sometimes pays the higher unlucky patients like can be caught in the crossfire. They receive care and have no idea what it will end up costing them. New research published in The New England Journal of Medicine on found that more than one in five patients visiting the emergency room may face the same financial shock. The study looked at billing data from one large national insurer and found that 22 percent of the patients who went to a hospital covered by their plan still received a bill from a doctor who was not in the insurance network. The average such bill cost more than though there was a wide the highest was for more than This is not the first time researchers have examined surprise medical but the broadest analysis to date of the problem nationwide. The study found wide variation across the country over the likelihood that someone would get a surprise medical bill. In for the rates of surprise billing were 89 compared with where it was near zero. Once patients get to the emergency they have little choice over who treats them. put it in very blunt This is the health equivalent of a said an assistant professor of health policy and economics at and a of the paper. Cooper argues that the problem could be solved by which could make the visit a package that includes both the doctor and hospital. Consumer and scholars like see the surprise bill as unfair. nearly impossible for patients to uncover the contract arrangements of individual physicians once they walk into an emergency room or are brought by ambulance. by and not aware that playing that type of financial said Chuck the programs director at Consumers an advocacy group that has been urging states and Congress to help solve the problem. follow the and they go to the and then just like a Several states have passed legislation aimed at tackling the including New and where a law recently went into effect. But the state laws affect only a fraction of insurance customers. Insurance offered by large like is regulated under federal law.

Congressman a Democrat from introduced legislation last year to tackle the practice but he said he experienced healthy dose of from his colleagues on the Ways and Means committee. had heard complaints of surprise bills from and it turns out that the new study found that is a hot spot for the practice. said he would introduce the legislation again next year. think that got to be a way to get consumers out of this he said. President included proposals to limit emergency room bills in his budget and recent regulations have made it more difficult for doctors to collect certain though those rules are being fought in court by physicians. The acting administrator for the Centers for and Services has said that surprise bills are a policy priority for him. The data in the study come from one large commercial but the researchers agreed not to name it in exchange for access. Cooper said there was only a little difference in the share of surprise bills in places where the insurance company had a lot of compared with those where it did less business. Emergency room doctors criticized the findings and were quick to blame the insurers. The College of Emergency the medical society that represents the said patients are much less likely to face large unexpected bills than the study citing an analysis the group did in of patients who were or asked to make up the difference between what the insurer pays and what the doctor bills. balance bills are less than a couple of hundred on said the president.

But our legal safeguards for writers and publishers foolproof. In the last few Trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press. The members of this club are innovators. They have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy. But an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like or even destroy entire media outlets. This kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection. Only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media report the news accurately and according to a survey conducted in 2015. This mistrust has been growing for a long but it was stoked by Trump during the campaign. He called the reporters who covered him and whipped up yelling and booing crowds.

The jury agreed with on that point and awarded him in damages equivalent of about million With similar cases The Times pulled its reporters out of But when the newspaper appealed to the Supreme the justices threw out the verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel. The court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with translated as or reckless disregard for the By the the number of libel suits and if suits did go to they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff.

The system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics. For government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the US constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players.

The once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters. By withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the Senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution.

Look to for a taste of the awful potential to the tragedies and history those coils of ego and empire and wealth sex and sex and that often end with bodies all over the place. The best thing Trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind and send the kids away far away from to do their own thing. Limit visits to holidays and bounce the grandkids on his not breathe a word about business or affairs of not how monarchies roll. That Trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law. Here again we can expect the monarchical model. People rarely grow in humility once they reach the White House. To the extent Trump attempts to spin and mutilate the rule of his most immediate potential check will be a Congress firmly in Republican led by the same wrecking crew already shown such faint regard for the constitutional with a think egging them on to new structures and traditions of governance are about to be tested as they been in generations.

Polls are often conducted over multiple so only just starting to measure the effect of the decision to release new details of its investigation into private email server to lawmakers on According to the Post tracking poll published on the Democratic candidate has now slipped behind on to her Republican The polling average calculated by a much better indication of national shows is now leading by just 2 percentage down from 5 percentage points a week shows Trump and neck and neck in unpopularity contest Read numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative polling neatly translate to votes. Far more important will be the turnout especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so close in terms of unpopularity. And the candidates know it. A senior adviser to Trump reportedly revealed last week that have three major voter suppression operations under intended to reduce votes for among white liberals and young though election day is still a week we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than ballots have already been cast under the US early voting system. Approximately 125 million to 145 million are predicted to vote in the 2016 so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total. Higher turnout than at this time in the 15 states that provide detailed information about those North and nine other states report more early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election. and showed a decline in early and those declines were signs of declining turnout from black voters and young early results offer mixed news for Early votes suggest that young voters who are much more likely than older voters to lean Democratic might be staying at home. In 12 fewer aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012. This could be especially problematic for if this group is indicative of a broader or sentiment in which supporters of the former Democratic candidate Sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for voters the only demographic group that appears put off. Early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states especially in North a state that yields 15 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests is in a close contest. If strategy is indeed to suppress the black that makes a lot of sense those voters could be crucial for to secure the White but up among good news for is that turnout is up across all states where early voting data is available. More votes from this strongly group is good news for but it might not be enough to offset declines in black and young votes. Because turnout has historically been it needs to increase significantly for this voting bloc to have a real impact. one other source of potential comfort for both candidates in all this. Maybe early voting behavior is a bad predictor of overall voting behavior. It could be that fewer young voters are casting their ballots now because they are just less likely to plan ahead than they were in 2012. Or might not be relying on young people for choosing instead to base more of her potential winning coalition on older who have consistently been a more reliable voting group historically. elections

Pharmaceuticals International is a onetime Wall Street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales in the process losing 90 percent of its market value. The first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its portrays it as a not a perpetrator. The Justice Department charged a former with taking about million in kickbacks from the chief executive of a specialty while hiding his true intentions from corporate management. had a relationship with and in 2014 paid million on an option to buy but it dropped the association last year. shut down in The criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier highlighted by an email from Davenport to Tanner evoking how the two men would be like Butch and the Kid and into the sunset off the cliff as in the The case appears to be a straightforward tale of but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the Justice Department. Was really the or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up so it could increase sales of its lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job greatly benefiting and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was lawyer took a similar claiming that also benefited which is why and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment in which sought to have prescriptions filled with the drugs through specialty pharmacies like rather than with cheaper generics. In that Tanner was and helped the company increase its sales. But executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its which Tanner is accused of resisting. The criminal complaint portrays Tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made a key outlet for drugs while working out a secret agreement with Davenport to get a cut of his profits. He is accused of pushing to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in Tanner received about million of payments to money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by Tanner. If they were trying to hide those the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which Tanner had signature which would be easy to and keeping the money in the United States rather than shifting it to an offshore account. At one the Justice Department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute. But the Supreme decision in Skilling v. United States in 2010 restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer. Figuring out whether the million constituted a kickback to Tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud. A federal statute cited in the Skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection a transaction. Whether the dealings with were will be the crux of the case against the defendants. The criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how Tanner kept senior executives in the dark about his role at and the benefits he would receive. He also made sure that played a crucial role in the alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners. Buying turned out to be problematic for when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded million in sales to the pharmacy. And after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with in its filings with the Securities and Exchange shut down the unit. But that does not necessarily mean that the relationship was or that the million Tanner received constituted an illegal kickback. was aware of how the mail order pharmacy and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical a key to Wall embrace of the company that took the stock to more than per share in 2015. The New Times described an view that benefited significantly from its ties to the allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the Unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been the defendants can argue that the development of was a benefit to and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time. A decision in 2016 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in in United States v. may offer a path for Tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the deal does not constitute fraud. In that the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned. The appeals court found negotiating and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this do not expect complete candor about negotiating as distinct from facts and promises of future stake in the deal may not have tainted the transaction even if he breached a fiduciary duty to by not disclosing any arrangement he had with Davenport.

In the week since J. election as president of the United much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter other Less has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting and their business interests though on it became clear that this is another potential at least when it comes to the first daughter Trump and a brand that is largely built on her image. A group of including reporters at The New Times and received an email from Trump Fine the upscale brand Ms. Trump founded in entitled and touting Trump wearing her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection on The a bracelet that costs on her was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her stepmother and grown siblings with on night. Such emails are not uncommon among fashion which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large. What was different about this was that it came not from the communications but from the vice president for the person in a brand who would generally work with a wholesale partners Ms. stores such as in and and Son in And that after pointing out the it urged recipients to share this with your In other it used Ms. appearance by her side to directly promote the selling of her products. When the vice said am not available for and when asked if she had sent the hung up the phone. But a day president of the Trump notification was sent by a marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary and like many of is still making adjustments We are discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going This is not the first time Ms. brands have used her role in her political career for marketing purposes. In Ms. Trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention also wore her own brand shoes and The next her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words look from her and a link to the where a similar style from the brand was offered. The dress reportedly sold out in a day. At the the decision was met with some even though the stakes were lower. Trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his White because they will be running his and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own though Section 713 of Title 18 of the United States Code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes. Ms. Trump has not come close to but the appearance is still ethically blurred. Whether or not Ms. Trump knew of the bracelet email before it was her name is still on the top of the alert. In the attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a such as Billy introduction of Billy Beer during his brother and the creation of Roger during his half brother terms in were roundly deemed inappropriate. The tension between Ms. position on her transition team and her but role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a makes the issue even more and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur. The question now is how she uses it.
Always quick to get to the social media came up with an instant distillation of the global response to the unsettling election of Trump as president of the United Trump to meet at the White House live updates Read declared that we had witnessed something more than a simple change of government. a slogan would not have circulated had Mitt beaten in it implied that Trump had not merely taken over the running of the United States for four but that his presidency represented a much darker threat that it in destroy the Twitter is prone to the hyperbolic and hysterical. But more sober commentators were raising a similar albeit in not quite such stark terms. the editor of the New spoke for many when he election of Trump to the presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the a tragedy for the and a sickening event in the history of the United States and liberal democracy It is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound For the millions who shared that dawn on felt like mourning in they fear is that Trump will make good on all the promises and threats he made during these last 18 months. What if he goes ahead and deports 11.3 million undocumented What if he really does ban all entering the What if he tries to use the powers of the state to go after media that have him making life difficult for the businesses that own inquisitive newspapers such as the for example as he has said he What if he overturns abortion even imposing form of on a woman who terminates a as he once And what if he really does build that Twitter How the 2016 US election night are plenty who believe that if Trump went ahead and actually implemented his he would create a different xenophobic and at odds with some of the founding principles religious equality or freedom of speech that have defined the United States since its founding. The country would still exist but it would no longer be there is a ready chorus of realists and quick to say that such talk is excessive. Those voices offer assorted forms of reassurance. they make the perennial claim that every successful politician whatever the bluster and rhetoric of the campaign always moderates once in office. This view holds it to be all but a law of nature that the radicalism of the candidate is always tempered by the reality of governing. Trump may have talked up a storm on his way to the White they but once behind the desk of the Oval practical considerations will surely constrain runs the there are formal mechanisms in place to do just that. The United after is ruled by a constitution that insists on the separation of so that the executive the president can never go too always held in check by both the independent in the form of the supreme and the Congress. These venerated institutions will surely prevent Trump from doing anything too crazy. Less but also to be taken into account is the federal a vast civil service of who will ensure that any Trump proposal is softened and smoothed into sanding off its more wild edges. And there is always the they surely let Trump get out of trouble none of those reassurances stacks up. Start with the notion that once he has sworn the oath of Trump is bound to tone it dropping his most incendiary plans. The trouble with that idea is that party bigwigs were saying the same thing throughout the earnestly hoping that Trump would change once he became the that he would change once he won the party that he would change once he started the campaign proper in Normal candidates do indeed do that. But with it never happened. Twitter Rams cheers as Trump speaks at a rally in Grand he kept sounding insulting bereaved military parents one a former Miss Universe the next. The only time he agreed to take direction was in the very final when he finally stuck to a message and read scripted lines from a teleprompter. But that was just for a few when the big shiny prize was in sight. It is a slim foundation on which to build the hope that a man with a proven lack of impulse control just grab them by the will miraculously transform himself the minute he walks through the door of 1600 if the restraint come from what about from there be institutions to hold Trump in The trouble Republicans did not only win the they also won both houses of Congress. That gives Trump enormous a strength that has eluded most of his predecessors. W Bush governed with a Republican Congress for a short spell. Before the last Republican to enjoy such might was in result is that Trump will face no congressional constraint. They will do his bidding. Some have suggested while their party affiliation might be the Trump will nevertheless encounter resistance on Capitol Hill because so many congressional Republicans are hostile to him. They cite the House who publicly clashed with Trump several times on the campaign once accusing him of making a example of a racist and who endorsed Trump only through gritted and Trump mark a Politicians must not pander to it Read will not dare oppose Trump now. Trump is the one with the national the winner of a much larger electoral college victory than anyone ever thought possible. Trump won states that had eluded the Republicans for he even took which had been in Democratic hands since 1988. That gives him huge clout inside the Republican party. He succeeded in doing what they had long failed to expanding the map and winning over white voters who had previously spurned so Republicans in Congress will be the junior partners in this new forced to bow to the man whose electoral appeal is so much stronger than theirs. He be their they will be his. If representatives were to dare to step out of Trump will ask them who the voters in their districts who will almost certainly have voted for him would back. The answer will always be pressure be applied only to Republicans. Witness this exchange between Newt to be a possible secretary of state in a Trump and journalist had asked about the proposed border wall with wondering if a Trump administration would really be able to get Congress to pay for it that no one believes ever despite hot pay for it replied that he would use the pressure of to bring doubters around. how many Democrats are up for election in the Senate in adding that the answer was 25. you really want to go home as the guy who stopped the by all but build it in if Congress promises to be what of the supreme surely the ultimate That body has a ready to be filled by the next president. Trump can nominate a pliant judge and the Senate will be unlikely to resist. That would instantly give Trump a 5-4 conservative majority on the highest court. And with several other supreme court justices in their late or other vacancies could appear too. Trump will have the chance to reshape the court in his image. can do the same for the lower rapidly filling up the federal bench with Twitter A man holds up an image of with the word above a Trump rally in Springs. once on the a judge can stay for life.

They will be servants. said that the military will behave in the same they will not want to be seen resisting democratically civilian other Trump will have enormous power from inauguration day on 20 2017. He can build his border wall if he wants to so memorable was the the political penalty for not doing so will be enormous. But he can do much more day he can at the stroke of a pen undo much of the legacy. Trump has had a team of aides draw up what they call the First Day a series of executive orders signed by that Trump could overturn with his signature before he has got his feet under the desk. Among the measures they have targeted for repeal the agreement on climate the refugee and the rules demanding checks on the background of someone seeking to buy a gun. By the end of that first would already be a changed work starts on the border most vociferous supporters will demand action on the other signature the deportation of those migrants. With Republican control of the House and he will have no excuses for inaction or delay. On there has been some advance work. One envisages a force of 90,000 equipped to make raids on restaurants and building rooting out illegal immigrants. As of chartered buses seats on and planes can accommodate would carry deportees to the border or to their home Others have talked of putting these unwanted people on trains and expelling them a method that evokes the darkest chapter in the Trump could work on his ban on entering the US. The constitution might strike that down as discrimination on grounds of but it would not be too hard to refashion it. Trump has spoken of banning arrivals from countries associated with which may be an effective workaround. And all the Trump would be shredding the legacy of first black abolishing which gave millions health there is another promise Trump will want to implement. It came during the debates when Trump pledged if he he would put in jail over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. He do that but he could steer his Justice Department to pursue perhaps via a special prosecutor. Who would stop him doing His base will demand nothing their cries of her are still ringing. only thing that might stay his hand is if he calculates that the threat of prosecution provides useful a sword to hang over the heads of the to ensure they keep quiet and out of his this is the country that Trump unshackled and unbound can starting three months from now. Oblivious to the hostile to snarling towards and seeking to roll back rights that took decades to secure. It would be a country that saw the constitution not as its greatest but as an obstacle to overcome. It would see diversity not as a but as a fact to be at best. And anyone objecting to any of this would find the big all three branches of arrayed against them. RIP It certainly might feel that what we saw in the astonishingly ugly campaign fought by Trump would be only an inkling of what is to follow. as one senior Democrat put it to horror show has not even started. This is just the elections

Now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain and features to keep a attention on the road. The initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The new guidelines from are the first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving. The agency cannot force electronics companies to but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and adopted for the most part.

The most striking thing about the poll released on is not how close and Trump are in how close they are in unpopularity. Such deep dislike could affect willingness to vote and all the more problematic for campaign given that the latest development in her email scandal could dent her popularity yet further. Some analysts claim that any such dip will be but with just eight days left until most of the US a decline would need to be very short. and Trump virtually tied in North and polls Read poll showed that the Democratic candidate is seen unfavorably by of likely voters while her Republican opponent is viewed unfavorably by Voting intention was similarly Trump which suggests that some voters are holding their noses and picking a president they like. The numbers are also mirrored when it comes to dislike of other of Trump supporters view unfavorably strongly and of supporters see Trump unfavorably say This was conducted 26-29 before news that the had acquired a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by a are often conducted over multiple days and some of them such as the presidential tracker collected some responses after the latest email news broke.

The major way that people are making sense of the race is to look at so to claim that news is affecting the polls but not ultimately the race makes little sense especially because barely a week of this election has gone by without some sort of scandal creating a polling or so there is no simple opinion equilibrium that we can measure. elections

A few years Yahoo chief executive Mayer hit the headlines concerning a confidential memo sent to employees. The message seemed to go against everything we know about how a economy operates.

But employees understood its real if we see we trust surprising that Yahoo staff were annoyed. known for years that employees are much more productive if able to harness the freedoms that mobile technology can afford. Being chained to an office can be in many occupations. Employees feel hard done by and fight back.

There has been much debate about the Teaching Excellence Framework since it was initially proposed. Some have called for an outright while others have come up with ideas about the principles it should follow. But I am interested in how to design an effective system to measure and improve the quality of learning and teaching across the higher education system. What would that actually look the Teaching Excellence Framework be Read are four things that need to be We need to that any form of measurement is expensive and to avoid wasting it needs to lead to improvements in practice. we need to accept that no measure is precise. Metrics are sledgehammers rather than lasers and at offer broad indications of quality. Any instrument that we are offered will be lubricated with vast quantities of snake need to take account of what we know from more than 40 years of research into learning and teaching in higher but also what we know about how institutions respond when they are assessed on performance need to that this involves designing an assessment rather than arguing over individual of a criteria will be based on a view of teaching. We need a clear basis on which to include and exclude each criterion. There are a number of potential frameworks that could be used for for the Teaching and Learning Research 10 principles of teaching and learning or the Professional Standards Framework for Higher Education. The individual metrics informing the assessment system need to be part of a collective and coherent system. This involves relating the metrics to the overall criteria and showing how they measure something that is identified as a necessary element of high quality teaching. The metrics should be measures of the quality of teaching rather than the prestige of institutions or the profile of their students. To improve their institutions would have to improve their teaching practices. The overall criteria should remain stable but the actual metrics should change every year. They should be drawn from a very large public bank of potential metrics. This is important so that institutions focus on improving the quality of their practices rather than fixing individual judgments offered by the should be relatively simple. They should be focused on the subject level rather than the institutional level because institutions have of variable of by these the current Year 2 version of performs In benchmarking the metrics by entry characteristics and flagging statistically significant differences are improvements on university league tables. not focusing on the subject level is a major flaw in the Year 2 ability to offer valid indications of quality this is in for Year reward for good teaching in We can push learners deeper into debt Read the impact of not basing the system on a vision of teaching quality becomes even more apparent in the discussion of future metrics. Measures that we know do not relate to the quality of learning and such as contact hours or are being pushed by the government. Measures that we know are such as the expertise of teachers or the ways students are transformed by are not even part of the issue is that if the is not based on a systematic view of then there is no basis on which to include or exclude potential measures of excellence.

In recent the film about and the movement to pardon the have renewed worldwide attention on the scope and substance of government surveillance programs. In the United the debate has often been a narrow focused on the rights of under domestic law but mostly blind to the privacy rights of millions of others affected by this quietly as the government is renewing its assault on your privacy Read just last a court held that intelligence agencies acted unlawfully by concealing bulk spying programs from the public for over a decade. in a lawsuit brought by Privacy the and eight other the influential court of human rights will also weigh in on surveillance programs revealed by and the result could have implications far beyond the debate in the US has led to some piecemeal reforms including the Freedom Act and modest policy changes many of the most intrusive government surveillance programs remain largely intact. These include programs conducted not just by the but also by its close partner in the United called the Government Communications Headquarters with whom the swaps vast sets of private data. This bulk surveillance violates rights to privacy and freedom of expression rights that are guaranteed not only under US domestic but also under international human rights law. That latter legal framework speaks a universal enumerating fundamental rights that every person enjoys by virtue of our common the we brought suit in challenging surveillance programs that violate these fundamental rights. The case has now made its way to the court of human where we recently filed our principal submission. The court plays a critical role in the international human rights system by enforcing the Convention on Human a treaty ratified by 47 nations. Its judgments are legally binding and its rulings help shape the interpretation of human rights law throughout the lawsuit challenges the mass surveillance of traffic transiting undersea as well as the access to information gathered through the breathtaking array of bulk spying programs. These have for the recording of every single cellphone call out and within at least two its collection of hundreds of millions of contact lists and address books from personal email and and its surreptitious interception of data from and Yahoo user accounts as that information travels between those data centers located abroad. The suit also seeks to shed light on the secret agreements governing access to these massive hoards of data and vice versa. While this lawsuit has clear implications for the rights of it matters for as well. It is one of the first direct challenges to mass surveillance within the international human rights framework. The judgments of the court of human rights influence the interpretation of other international human rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political which the US ratified in 1992. A determination by the court that mass surveillance is unlawful would call comparable surveillance programs into question by sending a powerful message that they are fundamentally incompatible with human international human rights law framework makes clear that government surveillance must be prescribed by targeted and proportionate. These requirements are designed to balance a need to address security threats and its obligation to protect fundamental rights. Bulk spying programs plainly fail that test. By their very bulk spying programs are neither targeted nor proportionate. They invade the privacy of broad swaths of people without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. Surveillance should be directed at obtaining specific intelligence in individual not indiscriminately subjecting all of our private information to government in both the and the legal basis for and full scope of government surveillance powers remain opaque. Critical safeguards such as independent judicial review of spying programs are hobbled in many The arrangements challenged in this case underscore a critically important fact as we are all foreigners to someone. The mass surveillance programs surely intercept the communications and data of If are concerned about other countries intercepting their information in bulk and sharing that information including with the US government then they should care about ensuring there is an international legal framework that constrains these activities. Just as human rights law requires that surveillance be prescribed by and government should adhere to the same standard. Outsourcing surveillance hardly lessens the intrusion. whether the or US intercepts the information itself or obtains the same flow of data from another intelligence the same protections should apply. As the debate over mass surveillance it is vital that we consider the ways in which this spying violates the fundamental rights of millions of individuals throughout the world. Should the court of human rights rule against mass its decision will have implications for the rights of and alike. security and

My husband and I are in our and have been together for 30 years. I cannot remember the last time we had sex it was at least four years ago. The last few he found it difficult and lost his erection. I know and I think I felt that maybe it was me somehow. The problem is that we have no intimacy at all. He has never been terribly demonstrative and I wonder if this is because his parents never but now we never never hold never cuddle. I have but it is very obvious that he want me near him he becomes stiff and awkward until I let go. At the every conversation we have turns into an argument at it seems better not to talk at all. Hence the idea of even starting to become close again is not something I feel I want to do. I see other couples our age holding hands and being affectionate even my who are now feel lonely. Our two children will soon both be gone. I often think about leaving but the reality is very difficult to think about. We have very little pension between us and our future depends on selling up and possibly buying somewhere smaller. If I were to leave we would both struggle for and I would certainly have no option of retiring from my which I find very stressful. We live as We share we do things as a family we eat together and share etc. We spend evenings together. We go out as a couple maybe once a year. I yearn for some love and affection from someone although I could go on as I when I think of the next 30 years or so without especially when my children have I feel very down. I know what to do. I know how to begin to leave him as I have nowhere to cannot afford to rent somewhere and want to leave our lovely house. I am going round in circles month after year after year goes by. I wish I could just have a break from him in the hope that we could then and make a new start. Some couples have or sex but a lot of and function well and are happy. Some couples have a great sex life but little else. The key is what both of you are happy and you are clearly not lack of intimacy seems to bother you the which surprising. Intimacy which a specialist in relationships once described to me as absolutely what was going on with the other is really about communication and that seems to be sorely lacking. Communication is hugely important in relationships. when a man loses his the partner it and then consulted a therapist who is such a common problem and usually it is disguising other major erectile dysfunction is not something to discount easily and be medically checked out in the first instance. Has your husband been to seen a I appreciate that it is a difficult subject for you to bring up with a man loses his the partner it and then retreats. What then tends to happen is people become more distant. They communicate and every conversation turns into an what may be happening if your partner fears erectile dysfunction is that he will fear physical closeness and you in turn interpret that as rejection. And so it goes parents not being overly affectionate with each other necessarily explain why your husband is like this. His generation tended not to be so Although we note that you say your parents are very affectionate together this may throw your own relationship into starker think it is very much worth trying to because you really think about splitting up if you tried as far as possible to fix this. I think therapy would really help either try your or find an accredited local therapist through the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists site would be most beneficial if you could go to therapy but you make your husband go. I appreciate that even asking him to go may be too much at the moment you can have couples therapy on your own and he can join you or not at all. It would be amazingly beneficial for you to talk in a safe place this problem is nothing to be ashamed you and your husband need is communication and when you do eventually sit down and it will be amazing what comes out. I always think that seeing yourself through someone eyes can be incredibly or incredibly alienating. That is the but either way it is illuminating unless you want to spend the next 30 years in this dulled it is a process you have to go through.

To ban them in ignore the voice of swathes of the population is to ignore the realities of modern The entitled Fascism and Social Divisiveness in the is a contradiction of the very values that the union claims it is protecting. nothing remotely liberal about silencing those you may not agree with.

Trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance. But he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it. This story has more about business ties. Trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the President from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings. But in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts. Trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children.

Insiders and the rich going to happily relinquish their power and and hand them to outsiders and the Most who call themselves Democrats never hear from the Democratic party except when it asks for typically through mass mailings and recorded telephone calls in the months leading up to an election. The vast majority of Democrats know the name of the chair of the Democratic National Committee or of their state committee.

It has no deep or no capacity for mobilizing vast numbers of people to take any action other than donate no visibility between no ongoing activism. If it is to be relevant to the the Democratic party must be capable of organizing and mobilizing in opposition to Republican party turning millions of people into an activist army to peacefully resist what is about to happen by providing them with daily explanations of what is occurring in along with tasks that individuals and groups can do to stop or mitigate their harmful must harness the energies and idealism of young people across the nation who were drawn to campaign because of its promise to get big money out of reverse widening turn the wildly expensive and baroque complex into a reverse climate end the militarization of our police and the mass incarceration of our people and stop interminable and warfare.

This election has forced to take notice of class divisions between workers. And while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural Rust Belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban worker rooted in a real dynamic. Many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of for specifically for cities in Southern and coastal states. There are clear economic reasons for their choice. Dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive. for all kinds of are also higher. In these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas. But moving outside region is relatively rare these and even more rare for someone without a college degree. Moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies. The United States has been one of the exceptions. It has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced and it has since at least the middle of the 19th century. A study comparing thousands of and census records between 1850 and 1880 showed that nearly of men moved across county while only a quarter of men did. For first internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land. But toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th migration began to be driven by people moving to cities small and large. This pattern added a twist after World War when more people began moving outside their local particularly to the Before the roughly 15 percent of lived outside a census division in which they were and by 1970 that had jumped to 25 percent. But in the people started moving less. Internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups. In the 3 percent of men moved across state lines each over the last decade that figure has dropped to 1.7 percent. The decline is similar for women. Between 2001 and the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma or nothing beyond a high school diploma Migration rates for people were roughly twice that. In the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in many states are at a disadvantage. Although they have some large they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas. The economists and Strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles.

We were offered the one remaining seat as it was our honeymoon and I was nervous about to for the first time we agreed to let another single passenger take it instead. We were assured we would each receive compensation of for being denied boarding. We spent six distressing hours at the airport trying to sort out the then three hours transferring to another airport for the next available thus missing a night in our hotel. Four months we have still not received compensation. A recent email from said only one of us would receive the payout and claimed that we had refused to take the spare even though another passenger had taken it instead.

publisher of The New Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record. J. of the United All so clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Room. a I I I am. a photo of the great man behind you. There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office. I heard thinking of putting it back. I indeed. I am. Wonderful. So got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a but useful and conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much. I appreciate too. I thought maybe start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions going to get this administration. I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New Times. Tremendous respect. very special. Always has been very special. I think been treated very rough. well out there that been treated extremely unfairly in a in a true sense. I only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Post was but every once in a while actually get a good article. Not but every once in awhile. I have great respect for The and like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think be very impressed with the names. be announcing some very shortly. Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people. I you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good. choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best. very important to me. You been given a great honor. been very tough. been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess coming out. just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what wildest expectation was. I know if it was I we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people. As you probably I did many speeches that last period. I was just telling that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different that the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20,000 have 15,000 people outside that get in. So we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would during the last two or three a day. a lot. Because not easy when you have big crowds. Those not an easy way of doing three a day. Then I said the last two I want to do six and seven. And not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in And we had 31,000 17,000 or 18,000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left do we lose I think we can lose And the reason I did it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that was hearing that going to lose which been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they want to lose So they went out along with President and Bill and they went to late sort of late afternoon and I go to It on the schedule. So I finished up in New and at 10 I went to We got there at 12 We started speaking around and we had 31,000 people and I I there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere. So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought going to win. We thought we were going to win We thought we were going to win North We did pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win The problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it. And I thought we were going to win it. And we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points. we won by 180,000 was that the More than 180,000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of. So we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole different campaign. I would have been in I would have been in and New and we have gone anywhere else. Which I mean rather do the popular vote from the standpoint think do actually as well or better a whole different campaign. if a like match play versus stroke play. a whole different game. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because go to a few places. I think the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. Until now. Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that never see otherwise. very interesting. Like I went to four times. I went to 2 for because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with got to got to get in. But there is no path to you have to get the one in so we kept going back to and we did get the one in We kept going to and we went to a lot of states that you spend a lot of time in and it does get you we actually went to about 22 whereas if going for popular probably go to or it could be three. You leave New stay in New and stay in So a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But sort of interesting. But we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the we have a great a great and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that I a technique in it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great and people have enthusiasm. And in the end she get the vote and we ended up close to 15 as you know. We started off at we ended up with almost 15. And more a lot of people show because the community liked me. They liked what I was saying. So they necessarily vote for but they show which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with which was which I never understood why I was doing because go to the rallies and have so many women holding up for But I kept reading polls saying that not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with especially certain women. DEAN executive editor of The New As you describe you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in But along with that and this is going to create a tricky thing for you you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the convention in this weekend. Who have a very I just saw that today. love to hear you talk about how going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its along racial lines. My first question do you feel like you said things that energized them in and how are you going to manage I think Dean. First of I want to energize the group. not looking to energize them. I want to energize the and I disavow the group. I know if reporting or whatever. I know where they were four years and where they were for and and all of the other people that so I just I had nothing to compare it to. But not a group I want to and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. What we do want to do is we want to bring the country because the country is very and one thing I did big league. very and going to work very hard to bring the country together. I somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was my I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics. And walking in and some people were cheering and some people were and she you have never booed for never had a person boo and all of a sudden people are booing me. She never happened before. politics. You all of a sudden they think going to be running for and a say. So something that I had never experienced before and I people are and she never booed before. But now they boo. You it was a group and another group was going the opposite. I want to bring the country together. very important to me. in a very divided country. In many ways divided. So going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions. political thank Dean. like to thank you for being here. This talked about not prosecuting We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means does that mean just the or the emails and the and how you came to that decision. there was a report that somebody said that not enthused about it. I want to move I want to move back. And I want to hurt the I really She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I added it was definitely the most I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. I would imagine. I would imagine. just telling not looking to hurt them. I think been through a lot. gone through a lot. really looking I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward. If I could we had a good conversation you and and it was off the but there was nothing just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the deputy managing So definitively taking that off the The but the question was asked. About the emails and the but just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and ever happened. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it it they used to say it was against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there a lot of recordings of But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious they say this this was the most. They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think very important to look forward. senior editor for Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the What would you say to I think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain that we have in many ways save our country. Because our really in big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big I talk divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate not doing it for that reason. doing it because time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of and I think that the people that supported me with such where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech. It was actually Election they showed up so that was essentially Election Day. I think understand very completely. L. opinion can I ask a One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the and spoken about is one very near and dear to my the whole issue of climate the how approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world cross I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like is a little bit off so be perfect. He say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be but will be in great shape. But really important to and I think to a lot of our to know where going to go with this. I think anyone objects you doing forms of energy. But are you going to take out of the lead of confronting climate looking at it very Tom. tell you what. I have an open mind to it. going to look very carefully. one issue interesting because there are few things where more division than climate change. You tend to hear but there are people on the other side of that issue who even We do hear it. I was on with this so I got an earful of it. is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. since living on an I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now seen it personally. Straight up. But you have an open mind on I do have an open mind. And had storms Not like this. You know the hottest day ever was in 98. You you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at He was a great scientist. He was a great guy. And he was a long time he had feelings this was a long time ago he had feelings on this subject. a very complex subject. not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was in or wherever five years Terrible. Where they got you so you see that and you this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you Clean air is vitally important. Clean crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some very successful golf courses. received so many environmental awards for the way you know. done a tremendous amount of work where received tremendous numbers. Sometimes say actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand true. Open mind. editorial page When you say an open you mean just not sure whether human activity causes climate Do you think human activity is or I think right now I think there is some connectivity. There is something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much going to cost our companies. You have to our companies are noncompetitive right now. really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my that lost 70,000 factories since W. Bush. 70,000. When I first looked at the I must be a typo. It be you have you think you have 70,000 factories And it a right. lost 70,000 factories. not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. not competitive for a lot of reasons. becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business they make deals with our or and then they adhere to the you know that. And much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So going to be studying that very and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened especially by people that believe in it. And let you know. hate to see Royal underwater. The North that could a good bureau I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation you will not pursue either one of you know have people that do things but my inclination would for whatever power I have on the is to say go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad go forward. And you you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made etc. etc. I think I think time for people to say go and solve some of the problems that we which are massive problems you I do think that gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. for whatever my attitude is strongly we have to go we have so many different problems to I think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very well I think it would be very you know talking about bringing and then they go into all sorts of I think it would be very divisive for the country. I I think speaking not as a journalist very healthy. and then going to go D. White House Mike Shear. I cover the White covering your administration See ya there. Just one quick clarification on the climate do you intend as you pull out of the Climate going to take a look at it. SHEAR And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to is that with And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. even just in the two weeks been instances where met with your business partners Sure. talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. experts who are lawyers and ethics say that all of that is totally so I guess the question for you what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things and are there any lines that you think you want to cross once in the White First of on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I think if run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation in no position to do that to no matter what I do. in no position to do that to and that but going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is you the cost to and be talking to you folks in the future about having to do with what just took place. As far as you potential conflict of I mean I know that from the the law is totally on my the president have a conflict of interest. been reported very widely. Despite I want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the the president And I understand why the president have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of but I built a very great company and a big company and all over the world. People are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all good. But I have to the partners come very successful people. They come they it be possible to have a my children are working on that job. So I can say to want to have a I can take a picture. I I think wonderful to take a picture. fine with a picture. But if it were up to some I would ever see my daughter again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That be good. That be good. But ever see my daughter That means have to make deputy you know. I I yeah. I do that either. I that work. I do I would never see I guess the only son be allowed to at least for a little would be because 10. so there has to be a very interesting case. You could sell your company With all due you could sell your company and then Well And then you could see them all the time. a very hard thing to you know because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal people really a big a big It really is all over the world. a great company with great assets. I think you selling real estate like selling stock. Selling real estate is much in a much different world. say and I mean this and I said it on the other My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I need I need and by the very I have a very small percentage of my money in very very small percentage of my money in in banks have said like to loan you like to give you any amount of been there had it both been been especially as you get is much better. Just a because an important question. I care about my company. I if a partner comes in from or if a partner comes in from where we did a beautiful big building that just and they want to take a picture and come into my and my kids come in I originally made the deal with these I mean what am I going to not going to talk to not going to take You have you on a human you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we in terms of health in terms of so many different things. I care about my company. It matter. My kids run it. say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on so every time somebody stays at that if they stay because I guess you could say a conflict of interest. a conflict of but not going to have anything to do with the and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I help but I care. I said on I care. Because it matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. political can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things for were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of about wind farms About meeting with Leaders of about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to what can you talk about that by the Was I involved with the wind farms not that I know of. I I have a problem with wind But you brought it up in the Which I know. I might have. With leaders of MANY With I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with just I the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of we make the windmills in the United States. made in and Japan. made out of massive amounts of which goes into the whether in our country or it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I for the most part they work. I think they work at all without and that bothers and they kill all the birds. You go to a you know in they have what is The golden And if you shoot a golden they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them they actually have to get permits that only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird With that being a place for them. But they do need subsidy. if I talk negatively. been saying the same thing for years about you the wind industry. I want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just including the and some But hard to explain. I care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. But the just to be the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president are trying to influence like wind I want to influence because not not that important to me. hard to explain. but the according to the see I figured something where you put something in this massive trust and also nothing is written. In other in I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 sign checks on my which I am phasing out of very you I sign the type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It it tells me going on a little bit and it tells contractors that watching. But I am phasing that out and handing that to Trump and Don Trump and Trump for the most and some of my so happening right now. But in theory I could run my business and then run the country perfectly. And never been a case like this where if you look at other people of they have this kind of asset and this kind of frankly. just a different thing. But there is no I assumed that have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize because I care about my business. is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in We own many incredible including I guess you heard. one guy that does when I say you know what that right. Do a little But going to run we have good going to run really well. So I have to do but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that come tell The New Times about I will. started it already. One of our great by the way. I can see that. started it already I greatly reduced the and the business. greatly reduced meetings with meetings with different people you also started by said over the last two once I decided I wanted to I want to build anything. like for we built the post be happy to ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of under and a terrific place. the hotel on Just so you General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Just so you know. Well good. But most of are made in most of are you and the are making most of them. They may assemble if you I think find that delivered there and they do most of the assembly. White House sorry I entered but I did want to ask you about You should introduce yourself. one of the White House correspondents. I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. I quite hear. Personnel. Personnel. You hired to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the been described by some as racist and I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government run. known a long time. If I thought he was a or or any of the things that we you the terms we can I even think about hiring him. First of the one that makes the not or anybody else. And will tell you that. 100 percent. And if he said something to me in terms of his or that I thought were inappropriate or number one I do and number he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know and in actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know and people that are on the left. But went to he was you he was very he was a Naval I think you I think very hard on him. I think having a hard time with it. Because not him. not him. known him for a long time. a very smart guy. I think he was with on top of everything else. What do you make of the website he The different. cover I mean like The New Times covers things. I I could say that is because they covered an story. I I am. take whatever you say. I am always but not cross The New Times covers a lot of stories that you rough stories. And you they have covered some of these but The New Times covers a lot of these things also. just a essentially. a newspaper. I know the a decent a very smart guy. done a good job. He been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that I would immediately let him go. And tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. But you are with all due that and and many folks who disagree with the coverage of and the slant that brings to the news view him that well first of is just a publication. you they cover stories like you cover stories. they are certainly a much more conservative to put it than The New Times. But really is a news organization become quite and got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean a pretty a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. tell you I know him very well. I will say and I will say if I thought that if I thought that he was doing or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the I think been treated very unfairly. very interesting a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. been the total opposite. been a great and just not there. And what the is saying is 100 percent true. And by the if you see something or get something where you feel that and you have some info I would love to hear it. You can call can call I would love to hear. The only one who call me is opinion She treats me too rough. I know what happened to She was so opinion For years she was so good. As we all say about not your just your turn. opinion I have a slightly but somewhat I guess. about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in especially Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on foreign even your daughter child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now in a situation where governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose and may differ with me a little on but always see on those views. Although right now loving me. right now they are. right now loves loves amazing how winning can change things. liked Chuck for a long time. raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck I had a a little in a little apartment building in in Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck came in and I gave I I know if willing to admit but I believe it was his first campaign But Chuck a good guy. I think get along very well. I guess my question how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will he governed more like than like Trump. I worry about that. I need to do this. I was telling I need to do this. doing this to do a good what I want to and I think that what happened in the Rust they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through you look back 20 they used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory empty and rusting. Rust is the good worse than falling down. I sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to to love as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people take care of these not going to win and going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what looking at right now. These people are really angry. and angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in I say the forgotten people they were totally forgotten. And going to bring jobs back. going to bring jobs big league. spoken to so many companies I plan on moving your not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think going to just sell it across what will be a strong you know at least going to have a border. But just plan on it. And tell I and hear announcements over the next couple of but I believe talked numerous comp in conversations with top people numerous companies that or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. Are you that those companies will keep their factories but the jobs will be replaced by They and make the robots too. a big make the robots too. Right now we make the robots. We make anything. But going I robotics is becoming very big and going to do that. going to have more factories. We lose 70,000 factories. Just do it. going to start making things. I was honored I got a call from Bill great we had a great I got a call from Cook at and I you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United or many big plants in the United where instead of going to and going to and going to the places that you go making your product right He understand I think create the incentives for and I think going to do it. going for a very large tax cut for which be happy But going for big tax we have to get rid of regulations are making it impossible. Whether liberal or I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. gotten to be a And companies they even start they choking. I tell one thing I would giving a big tax cut and giving big regulation and seen all of the small business owners over the United and all of the big business met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I never said because the tax going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But leaving also because of the regulations. And I would of the and I would not have thought regulation substantial regulation are more important and more enthusiastically than even the big tax cuts. I wanted to ask there was a conference this past weekend in of people who pledged their allegiance to you are really into this I think we answered that one right off the bat. Are you going to condemn Of course I of course I did. He already did. Are you going to do it right I maybe you here. Sure. Would you like me to do it do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn. go with that. like to move to and then go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking a lot of the jobs you are talking about is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few not the but an important factor. going for a lot of between between between health care going to talk repeal and replace. health care is you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and not even getting the deductibles are so you have deductibles So paying all of this money and they even get health care. So very important. So there are a lot of things. But is going to be a part of it. part of I even think a big part of it. going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than but infrastructure is still a part of and talking about a very infrastructure bill. And not a very Republican thing I even know frankly. It worked for Franklin It work for because unfortunately they spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You nobody can find out where that last you from a few years ago where that money went. And going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a a big one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible the I mention the name but a certain truck company that makes they call them the of trucks. You the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he going to buy the cheapest trucks I can And I and you and this is the biggest guy he trucks are coming going from New to and all busted up. The highways are in such bad hitting hitting He not buying these trucks going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can the exact expression he cheapest trucks and the strongest hitting so many bad you I tell been doing this how 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I you ever seen it like He roads have never been like an interesting What what curious what and said when you going to launch a infrastructure Are they reluctant to spend Honestly right now Trillion. I was the figure. Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would but not going to be able to do that and balance the see if I get it done. Right now in love with me. Four weeks ago they in love with me. forget if I read The New and you have to put this on the record it can be if you you might not want You say but you do I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I quote right there if love to reread it I know. But when you look at the all the I was going to lose the I was going to take the House with and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the and I mean easily you look at those I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency I helped numerous senators in fact the only senators that get elected were two one up in New who refused to say that she was going to vote for who by the way would love a job in the administration and I thank on the record. This is where different than a politician I know what to I just believe sort of interesting. love to have a job in the I thank She refused to vote for me. And a senator in who frankly he endorsed me then he and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I thank good You see what happens. I off the I hope you lose. Off the record. He He was up by 10 points you know who talking about. others if you look at he was down five points a few days before the he called for I gave him and I think I was up like over 30 points in I was leading by a massive 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. brought over the finish line. we brought you that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Winning was big something that I came So right now in very good but I came here thinking be awed and overwhelmed by this but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it. I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the as anybody would but I I feel so comfortable and you know it would to a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say and have a lot of the folks here done a great And I mean just a conservative not talking conservative. I mean done a good job. To follow up on after you met with President he described you to folks as that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign something we touched on and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order a world order led by in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the which have been in place for decades. Sure. I had a great meeting with President I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 15 minutes because there were a lot of people waiting for both of us. And it ended up being you were there I guess an close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said I think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have you we come from different sides of the but nevertheless something that I know if like him. I probably thought that maybe I but I I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. spoken to him since the meeting. What did you say to Just a basic conversation. I think looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I telling we had a that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great it was just a very good meeting. Sort of like this meeting. He told me what he thought what the biggest problems of the country which I think I should I mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the he told me things that he considered but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the which rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good I it mean going to agree on but I hope that we will have a great relationship. I really liked him a lot and a little bit surprised telling you that I really liked him a lot. go foreign sure. Sure. What do you see as role in the Do you believe that the role such a big question. The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global paying more for things because they were in our ultimate one hears from I is really shrinking that role. I think we should be a nation builder. I think tried that. I happen to think that going into was perhaps I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil I think going into was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it I think we got out of it then lots of bad things including the formation of We could have gotten out of it differently. I think going in was a terrible mistake. we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting forever. I have a different view on than everybody else. not everybody but then a lot of people. I had to listen to give me a break. I had to listen to Graham talk you attacking and you and like now attacking attacking attacking. And what are we getting and what are we And I have some very I have some very strong ideas on I think happened is a horrible thing. To look at the and not just talking deaths on our which are but the deaths I mean you look at these where massive and they say two people were injured. thousands of people have died. And I think a shame. And ideally we can get do something with I spoke to as you he called essentially How do you see that Essentially everybody called all of the major and most of them spoken to. Will you have a reset with I use that term after what you previously. I think I would love to be able to get along with and I think like to be able to get along with us. in our mutual interest. And I go in with any preconceived but I will tell I would say when they used to during the Trump loves loves I it be say this in front of thousands of it be nice to actually report what they it be nice if we actually got along with it be nice if we went after which by the aside from being very and have been even allowed to and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with or that I believe strongly if we can get along with a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only but that we get along with other countries. managing On would you you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the can you describe that for I can only say We have to end that craziness going on in One of the things that was told to me can I say this off the or is everything on the if you want to I want to I want to violate a If you want to go off the we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and we are off the record for this moment. speaks off the Now we can go back on. going to play the cop here. got only two and a half minutes because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the I want to thank you on behalf of all of us Thank you. for this and really I mean that. We are back on the record. you get the last question. Is he a tough Is he I have two very quickly. One is your vice left open the idea of returning to You talked about that on the campaign trail. hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this and also what are you hoping that will do in your administration and will you bring him in I hear the second question. What will role be in your Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I want to have people saying Even though the president of the United States I hope whoever is writing this written fairly the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants he or she wants. But I want to go by that. a very smart guy. a very good guy. The people that know a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with and the I would love that would be such a great achievement. Because been able to do it. Do you think he can be part of I think be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the knows the knows the players. I would love to be and you can put that down in a list of many things that like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell really great people tell that you do it. had a lot great businesspeople tell you do impossible. I I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being killed. At some when do they I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that. And on Where are you and I met with General who is a very respected guy. In I met with a number of other they say the finest there is. He is being seriously considered for secretary of which is I think time time for a general. Look at going on. We we beat we win anymore. At anything. We win on the we win with we certainly win with the military. General is a highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I what do you think of He said I was surprised he never found it to be He always give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with And I was very impressed by that answer. I was because known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said not saying it changed my mind. we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and not allowed to But tell you I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If so important to the I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General found it to be very less much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say you know known as Mad Dog Mad Dog for a reason. I thought say lose He actually give me some cigarettes and some and do with going to go to our Mark for the last question. Very powerful man MARK Thank and a really short but after all the talk about libel and libel are you committed to the First Amendment to the I was hoping he going to say that. I think be happy. I think be happy. somebody said to me on they a great softening up those but you may get sued a lot I I never thought about I I have to start thinking about I think be I think going to be fine. thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this. Thank you very a great honor. I will The Times a great jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. looking for the same and I hope we can all get along well.

No election has a global impact to match a US presidential contest. Few White House races have been more bitter than the current one between Trump and So any public official who intervenes in 11 days before needs to be very sure what they are doing. Such interventions come bigger than the director announcement that the bureau is reopening its probe of private emails. The potential impact is huge. Until last was looking on course to hand Trump a decisive beating. It may still happen. But that is now all up in the appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he It is certainly true that US politics has become so and so riddled with paranoia that the director faced an unenviable choice. If he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the whatever the one or both sides would be certain to cry foul. Conspiracy theorists would have had a field day. Yet by making it public he makes the investigation itself into a issue in a contest that will shape not just but the world and is precisely why the US Justice with which the has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias. The department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election. A memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of US attorneys general every four including in 2016. has broken with this. Former Justice Department officials from both political parties have denounced him for this over the weekend. The current attorney general is believed to have advised against has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways. the investigation is at an embryonic stage. It may go no further. In his announcement he spoke of emails appear to be to the previous investigation he completed concluding then that there was no case to answer in the summer. But the emails come from a separate may not even be from at all and the chief has not read them. His phrasing was extraordinarily vague. has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo. There are echoes of police blunders over child sex allegations. Even louder are the echoes of fanatics like Judicial Watch. This strikes at the democratic not just should not have deferred to as he did last week. The investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics. especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a and acrimonious polity as the US Congress has become.

This is a concern for some especially those on humanities courses who have only a couple of contact hours a and compare themselves to friends studying medicine or dentistry. But difficult to make value on this basis. Not all contact hours are the same class sizes and teaching vary hugely. Research funded by the Quality Assurance Agency found that students did not want more contact time if it simply meant more large lectures. When asked what would help them select a students wanted to know if they would be taught by trained teaching staff in small settings. Focusing on measuring contact time runs the risk of obsessing about the number of rather than the quality or the importance of activities and work the findings from the Engagement Survey provide further evidence that simply allocating more classes to students might not benefit asked students to their development of academic skills such as writing and critical thinking.

How did this celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so Who were the supporting him and When I started my unusual assignment of covering the presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for an news organization one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the nomination and ultimately to the presidency. Going back through my journey across there were many clues to rising although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies. The broad topography of Trump country in many easy to trace. It is a place of anger and gripped by a feverish sentiment. People wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life. Yet other factors were at in this unruly factors that sometimes made it hard to see talk social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It always clear which elements were powering the as the movement called and which were being buoyed along. One of my first stops was a decimated coal town in West It had a sports which offered beer for on and a biker bar it was patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke. Both were filled with Trump little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the environmental regulations and cheap natural gas. In I also saw how message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on many glossed over the three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. like Trump told Stern in It was hard to but perhaps that was the that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this one in which outrageous might offer a route to success. Around that Apple released its seventh iteration of the that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every are the words in Assembled in As if is a separate country. And how many in Trump country saw it that instead of being part of the they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas. One thing that like many and other had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate traded on pessimism. His Great embodied a vision that aimed to restore pride in the military and but also scapegoated minorities and At most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about prejudice toward was openly a factory owner in told me that children in which has the largest percentage of had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks. The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat a black woman in her who worked at a record label in a driver in Las a doorman in At a rally in the final week in a Rust Belt state that would prove central to I saw how the candidate connected with crowd. When he it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his listening for the smallest murmur of which he would seize upon and amplify. It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians seen during my years based in What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the loyalists. polls suggested that Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political including dismissed the notion that Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters. like the hunt for the lost tribes of the was how a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican Mitt put it early on. you paddle your canoe far enough up the and bang your drum hard they will come to the riverbank. But just not But when I mentioned the polls showing Trump lagging to his they snorted derisively. Everyone they knew was voting Trump children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who voted for decades. The they were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow. At the I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad the Trump supporters were right in key their votes were by pollsters. The winning margin in many like was and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. the driver who took me from a Trump rally to the was a case in he was an a registered and he did not intend to vote. of them look any good to he said. benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international Why did so many seem to hate her so The answer had many Fatigue from her decades in public unfinished business from her time in power in the distaste for how she had handled his sexual outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street unfiltered sexism. And simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it. In while I was visiting my one of his friends offered an explanation. like getting socks for again he said. bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like in the found the of white voters. They heard his and voted as a bloc like never before. stunning victory echoes jolting changes in and other countries where a new brand of politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of or represented a more fundamental may now be answered under the Trump presidency.
Wall Street regulators began an exodus from on as the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange announced plans to leave the agency. The decision makes Ms. a former federal prosecutor who has served more than two decades in the federal the first major administration appointee to step down after J. upset victory last week. Other financial regulators are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks. The election of Trump is a for the and for that all financial agencies. Ms. White was expected to leave no matter the outcome of the election. But many Democrats had hoped that if she would choose a strong proponent of regulation to succeed Ms. whose policies often reflected a political middle ground. the agency is almost certain to be pushed to the right. Trump has vowed to dismantle the financial regulatory overhaul Congress passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. And although will more likely be watered down than his appointments will no doubt shift the tone and priorities across financial regulatory agencies. The biggest move on Wall Street could be his choice for Treasury secretary. short list is said to include an investment manager and former partner who was campaign finance and Representative Republican of and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. is still being in part because of pressure from but is the favorite of Wall Street according to someone with direct knowledge but who was not authorized to speak publicly. A decision is expected within 10 days. Either the Trump Treasury Department might rein in the Financial Stability Oversight a collection of regulators who examine financial risks and designate companies as systemically important. The Treasury secretary is chairman of the council and could effectively according to a policy analyst at Capital Alpha who predicted that the council might essentially become quarterly Trump was elected at a pivotal time for the an agency that had already turned a corner under Ms. White. Unlike L. who inherited a after the financial Ms. White needed not to save the but to modernize a task that the next administration also will face. Ms. which will take effect at the end of the administration in will set off speculation about whom Trump will select to succeed her. Though such talks have barely the field of potential contenders could include S. a Republican commissioner at the agency. S. a former Republican commissioner who has advocated is leading effort to select a new chair for the agency and could be a candidate. a hedge fund manager who supported is also advising the transition team. the head of the got to get back into reffing the game properly and end the of Wall said in an interview last week before his appointment to transition team. As other of President financial regulators step the firewall around his Wall Street legacy will start to crumble. Timothy the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading is expected to leave by early though he could briefly stay at the agency as a Democratic commissioner. An even bigger change could occur at the banking regulators the Federal the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency which became a thorn in the side of Wall Street under President Martin J. and the leaders of the and will probably leave office next year when their terms or possibly even sooner. the Federal Reserve governor who oversees many of the central regulatory is not expected to serve out his term through early 2022. He could leave early next which would deliver a blow to proponents of Wall Street regulation. With turnover at the Ms. legacy could be in jeopardy as well. She oversaw a record number of enforcement actions and directed a rapid pace of based not only on but on regulations of her own making. Those initiatives were aimed at improving money market fund regulation and the broader asset management industry. think what done so far has been quite and really modernized that core Ms. White said in a recent interview. Yet Ms. White has not completed more than a dozen nor has she formalized a plan to require that financial advisers act in their best interests. Now that these initiatives will fall into the hands of a Republican they may come off the agenda. As it Ms. a political drew criticism from liberal lawmakers who view her as the quintessential moderate. Senator the Democrat who channels the populist outrage over Wall Street even called on President to designate a new leader because the agency had not required companies to disclose political contributions. In her first public remarks on the Ms. White said in an interview that the criticism does come with the think a very constructive recipient of constructive she not like you like people to beat on your whoever they however baseless it Before the Ms. White was the first woman to become United States attorney in one of the most apolitical jobs in government.

Ms. White is known for keeping a schedule. Colleagues said it was common for her to hold a 9 conference before dispatching night emails and placing a call to senior staff. But she also promoted staff morale by holding coffee and sessions. Every holiday she would give a party for her staff at where she would hand out gifts to each of her children.
